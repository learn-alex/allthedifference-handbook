 
*9. Page 88: Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity: Type is too small. “O” in “On” needs to be capitalized.

1390: 15. Beginning on Page 10, Chapter Four, Topic 2: Managing Crises. This topic has three subheads: personal/emotional, academic, and health and well being. These should stand out in some way.
 
1676 - Need a sidebar ul class that is different than the in-text ul class -- 22. Page 143 is a mess. The Strategies to Manage Time Sidebar has been split incorrectly. The Plan shown under Story Sharing is incorrect. I’ve attached the full correct text for that Sidebar. It needs to be redone. Size of type needs to be smaller to match other Sidebars – and put with blue background.
 
1995 - 27. Page 182: Topic 3: Correct line split “Job or (line split) graduate/professional school.”


Introduction and Purpose 

Can you add space between the 3 bullets?  

31. In the Introduction Background

Robert's story photo looks strange, maybe the angle that was taken.

Krishaun's image seems to have the same problem.

32. Clip 1: Once I viewed it, I could not watch it a second time without closing the Handbook, relinking it, and starting over. 

Introductory Video is really clip 1 from the first chapter. If you mean it here as a placeholder, Tod still owes you the real trailer. That said,  since the Introduction sets the tone for the Handbook, we think it should be very consumer-friendly for students with lots of photo images and other high end graphics and design. However, as there is only the one clip, I am selecting more than the 3 images from clip 1 that we agreed to from each of the clips, because there are about 16 pages of text material. 

	.34 Robert  
	.40 Krishaun
	1:09 Robert
	1:20 during the creed
	1:27 wrestling
	1:32 math class professor
	1:44 classroom
	1:55 basketball

 33. Can we also use the tag-lines that each clip contains as a design element after individual clips to serve as a reenforcement for the teachable moments of the clips? While I see it right below the clip, should we have it other places? I can resend you a list of all the tag-lines if that helps move the process forward faster. 

34. Under the Format and Content section, please create space between those bullets also.

With the format section, let's have space between the bullets also.

35. Right after the Format section bullets is a paragraph that talks about Vocabulary building. It says that it is supported by BOLD PURPLE highlighted words. However, you have changed the color to a blue or aqua, whatever you want to call it. 

36. Between Resources and Chapter 1, please leave more space so each chapter feels more separation. 

37. Table of Contents that you have in grey on the left will include some sub-headings in chapter 4, which we will get to you by the end of the week. Can the grey be changed to something more lively? 

38 Chapter 1

	1:32 math class professor
	1:44 classroom
	1:55 basketball

39 Can the creed be located closer to clip 2? How about right after the clip or just before?

Images for clip 2:
	.15
	.26
	1.03

40. Does it help if we also sprinkle in the various slides that Tod has in clip 1? For example, at 1:17 "A school can make all the difference." 

41. While watching clip 3 on expectation from my ipad, I saw that all the text that was at the bottom of the screen, the lower portion of the wording was getting cut off from the screen. 

  42. Images for clip 3:
	.20
	.41

43. Clip 4: The clip "Mindset of success..." is flawed and there seemed to be glitches in the MarQo clip

Emma, I will get you more clip images on Thursday. I wanted to get the above 3 clips over to you so you can quickly verify that I should just keep going with around three images per clip and that the time codes are helpful to you.       Meanwhile, we also found these additional errors in your online Handbook. Since there is no page numbers in the online, we are marking them so that they correspond to text pages we handed in to you:


46. I wish the exercise about finding who you are in making college choices were shaded or something to make it stand out as an exercise and not just text.

47. p.43 Just before the take aways-- "key support people" is smashed together. There are several places where that happens. Next one is under Networking p.46 where it talks about thank you notes "love to" is smushed. Also  p.54 bullet 2 "find these"  and p. 56 under homework bullet 3 "write about" is smashed. p. 63 under managing crises "list some" is mushed twice. p. 72 " better "than sitting" , p. 79 re planner "to accomplish" is smushed; p.82 paragraph after clip "list other", p.83 reading on humanities "index of", p.86 there are three items:  absences "stated explicitly, story sharing friend "to share", research sites "library where" p. 90 after scenarios "list other" 

48. p. 72 before the link to myths about drugs there is the word "is" which does not belong.

49. p. 73 the reference to Krishaun's brother the Krishaun's name is messed up.

50. p.81 Opal's tips got moved into the main text instead of the box-- part in box and part not.

51. p.89. The blog duplicates one we used earlier. I would switch to this one which is a better fit: http://huff.to/113Hc7u

52. Some of the hyperlinks are not clear as such. Can they be a stronger color? For example, on p. 93 the link to the Occupational Handbook is not as clear as it is in our draft. 

53. p. 94 Should we address the statement Krishaun makes that we can barely hear after his brother's death that he is not sure about a career in criminal justice (as a cop or marshal we assume)? This becomes a life circumstance that changes his perspective. We don't know what will be next but should we note it?

54. Should hyperlinks be more distinctive. They blend in color to the text and so may get missed for what they are. 

55. Should we make all website references hyperlinks too e.g. wetfeet.com, Monster.com. etc. 

56. There was no clip for preparing for online interviews and the last City Year clip is missing as you know.
