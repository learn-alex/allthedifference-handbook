51. p.89. The blog duplicates one we used earlier. I would switch to this one which is a better fit: http://huff.to/113Hc7u

53. p. 94 Should we address the statement Krishaun makes that we can barely hear after his brother's death that he is not sure about a career in criminal justice (as a cop or marshal we assume)? This becomes a life circumstance that changes his perspective. We don't know what will be next but should we note it?

54. Should hyperlinks be more distinctive. They blend in color to the text and so may get missed for what they are. 

55. Should we make all website references hyperlinks too e.g. wetfeet.com, Monster.com. etc. 

56. There was no clip for preparing for online interviews and the last City Year clip is missing as you know.
