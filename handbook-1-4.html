<h2>Chapter One: Expectations About College</h2>
<p>In the beginning of <em>All the Difference</em> we see South Side Chicago with its street shootings and arrests of predominantly young black youth. Watch the following video clip to view the challenging urban environment in which Robert and Krishaun live and to hear their determination to beat the odds. Krishaun asks himself whether he is scared. "Yeah. I know that the future can be disturbed or can be messed up by one wrong decision that I make." <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"How you deal with where you live can make all the difference."</em><p> 

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> Is any of this familiar to you? How is your life the same, or how is it different? What are the threats from your environment that could keep you from getting a high school diploma and then a college degree? What fears do you have that your life could be "messed up"? What or who keeps you from feeling that failure is <strong>inevitable</strong>?</blockquote>

<p>In the next clip, we see Robert and Krishaun in their charter high school, affirming, "We are the young men of Urban Prep." Watch Robert and Krishaun reciting the Urban Prep creed with their schoolmates. The creed tells us the school's expectations for behavior, attitudes, and success. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Pledging positive commitments can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What in the creed sounds like something you believe in? Do the expectations set forth in the Urban Prep Creed seem possible? Why? Would you want to adopt such a creed for yourself? Write a personal creed that will be more relevant and motivational for you. ###  Many academics and business professionals say that writing down a goal makes it more powerful.</blockquote>

<p>Graduation from high school is a major achievement, but Tim King, principal and founder of Urban Prep, sets a higher expectation for the graduating class: to send him invitations to their <em>college</em> graduations. At the graduation ceremony, Robert and Krishaun's family members comment on what it means to them and how they feel about the moment. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Hearing optimistic expectations can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> Does Tim King sound like anyone you know? Maybe your principal or a teacher? Who has high expectations for you &mdash; especially to graduate from college? Why is what they say important to you? Are you prepared to push yourself to meet those expectations &mdash; for them, but mostly for yourself? If so, you're ready to start planning for college.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity:</strong> Why is college important to you? Think about it on your own. Talk to a friend, parent, adviser, or mentor about your thoughts and plans. Make a commitment to yourself. ###</p> 
<ul>
	<li>List personal dreams and how college might help you to fulfill them. ### </li>
	<br>
	<li>List obstacles to those dreams including financial barriers to attending college (and how you might overcome them). ### </li>
	<br>
	<li>Choose a buddy who will help you to stay on track in your pursuit of a college education...and then keep it real. Talk regularly to your buddy, ideally someone in college or someone also hoping to go to college. Make a pledge that you'll both succeed. ### </li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have a commitment to go to college, focus on three decisions you need to make to gain admission to a college: decide on which college to attend, how to get there (including financially), and how to prepare to manage your expectations once you are in college. These can make all the difference in the college experience.</p>


<h3>Topic 1: Thinking about expectations</h3>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> When you were a young child, people started asking what you wanted to be when you grew up: a fireman, athlete, teacher, or doctor. Parents expect certain behaviors and are pleased or disappointed depending upon how you act &mdash; maybe making you a little crazy. Speaking as a parent myself, we want others to see our children as special and unique. Think of the prideful bumper stickers saying, "My child is an honor student at..." We want to boast. Sometimes parents think that their children's successes or failures are reflections of themselves. This puts added pressure on their children.</p>

<p>What have you done that your family members boast about? What are some of the things they expect from you? Do you agree with their goals for you? You may have higher or lower expectations for yourself. The main thing is for you to be comfortable with whatever the expectations are that you are planning to act upon. Talk to your parents, a teacher, or a mentor about what you expect from yourself and feel others expect from you. ###  If your expectations match theirs, or if you understand and agree with their expectations, you will find less conflict along the way.</p>

<p>Robert has set himself expectations to succeed in college and go on to medical school. We follow him as he arrives at Lake Forest College, which has given him "a lot of money: an instate scholarship, a leadership scholarship, and an academic scholarship." Robert is <strong>assiduous</strong> and <strong>tenacious</strong>. He asserts, "There's no stopping me." He plans to make his family proud. Watch the video and listen to what Robert wants to achieve in college. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Developing a mindset of success can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What impresses you the most about Robert? In what way would you like to be like him? What does "mindset of success" mean to you? How can your expectations for yourself help you to develop a winning mindset of success of your own?</blockquote>

<p>High school graduation has significance for families, fulfills their expectations, and leads to new expectations. It is a huge achievement and a stepping stone to more. Krishaun's family celebrates at his graduation trunk party. His Aunt Beverly comments that the majority of young men coming from Krishaun's background don't "escape." She talks about Krishaun's wise choices and excellent school. His mother expresses her pride about how far her son has come. His cousin believes that Krishaun will succeed and "give back to his community." <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Supportive families and communities can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What makes you think that Krishaun will succeed? How do you feel about your own upcoming high school graduation or other moments of success? What do those times represent for you and your family members? How have they made a difference to what you have done or how good you feel?</blockquote>

<p>In the previous clip, Krishaun's three elementary school teachers express concern that "we are constantly losing our young black men." Do you believe it is tougher to achieve your goals than it might be for women or students of other races or ethnicities? What are the family and community supports Robert and Krishaun have, e.g., family, school, church, mentors, and advisers? How have these supports proven helpful so far, and how have they made all the difference in their lives? Think about your own support system. Do you feel you have the tools to fulfill your own expectations and those of others about you? Who are the people you can count on to support your goal to attend college?</p>

<p>Ask your parents, mentors, or advisers what tools they have used to achieve their own goals. ###  Will these tools and supports also help you to succeed? What have people said to you that made an impression? For example, here is what Robert says he learned from his first wrestling coach, Mr. Price:</p>

<blockquote>[Paraphrase] Wrestling <em>is</em> life. When you wrestle, you struggle. You have to tie up with your opponent, grapple with him, just as you need to grapple with life. You're going to have obstacles in life and responsibilities: you have to do your homework, pass a test, wash the dishes, or baby-sit. In wrestling, you have to pin down your opponent and beat him by points. Don't let your back touch the mat. Be on your toes. And think.</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> How has Robert understood his coach's advice? How would you apply his coach's advice to your life?</blockquote>

<p>One aspect about planning for and going to college is that families need to let go. You need to help prepare them through your actions and words. Your good behavior starting now &mdash; in high school &mdash; will show them you can be trusted to take care of yourself as a more independent person in college. What are some actions you can take that will assure your family that you are college ready? ### </p>
<ul>
	<li>Start with open communications with family members &mdash; so they know where you are and what you are doing.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Share your questions and concerns and involve them in your decision making. This builds their confidence and helps you avoid conflicts.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Show them a new list of responsibilities you're committed to doing, beginning right now. This will help to convince them you can be trusted to take on the independence of college life.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Story Sharing:</strong> Ask someone you are close to and/or admire to share a personal story about how they managed the expectations (positive or negative) of others. Perhaps they have a story about the challenges of planning for higher education or an unexpected career and the choices they made. Discuss who has made all the difference in helping them make good choices that led to their success. ### </p>

<p>Watch this video of Krishaun talking about people in his life who have inspired him. He talks about his uncle who "taught him to be a man" and lets him know "what he's going to school for." About his tutor, MarQo Patton, at Fisk University, Krishaun says, "I really look up to him. He's been through some of the same things I've been through." He describes him as "having a bright future" and says he [Krishaun] wants "to get to where he [MarQo] is." <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Knowing the stories of role models, who have succeeded despite the odds, can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions: </strong>What advice given by MarQo is something you would like to try? What are the advantages to having different kinds of role models &mdash; older family members or young black men who may be only a year or two ahead of you in school? What other kinds of role models have you found to be useful? What new ideas do you have to find people who can help you to achieve your dreams?</blockquote>

<p><strong>Find stories of others who have succeeded</strong> despite challenging odds or who have defied low expectations. Some may be in your family or community such as a relative, minister, or coach. Some may be public figures who have met their own challenges along the way. A starting place for stories is the wonderful documentary <em>Black List: Volume 1</em> that was directed by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders and Elvis Mitchell. ###  This 92-minute documentary, which premiered on HBO in 2008, uses the personal stories of accomplished African Americans in fields as varied as business, entertainment, literature, sports, and the media to comment on the social, political, and economic progress black Americans have made in the past 50 years. It won the 2009 NAACP Spirit Award for Best Documentary. <a href="http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-black-list-volume-one/synopsis.html">http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-black-list-volume-one/synopsis.html</a><p>

<p>Make or bookmark a list of films or stories that you can view or read when you need inspiration. ### (Hint: see the homework assignment below.)</p>

<strong>Homework</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Often the people who most inspire us are not famous. Think about family, school, or community members who have been successful in some way large or small. This could be a local barber, high school teacher, minister, or business owner. It can be an uncle or a mentor. Whom would you like to interview to hear their stories? ###  You can build a valuable skill, hear amazing stories, and have some fun by videotaping interviews with people you admire and want to <strong>emulate</strong>. Create a video that can be an inspirational piece for yourself, or that you can send as part of your college application to show your thoughts and talents. ###</li>
	<br>
	<li>In addition to local heroes in your community and life, as a young person you may be unfamiliar with your culture's history and heroes. Use the following list and find out about them &mdash; not only what they have achieved but also what they may have had to overcome to become who they are. Ask a few friends to research names/people, too, and then share what you find out. Here are some ideas: Vernon Jordan, Whitney Young, Martin Luther King, Jr., Barack Obama, Kenneth Chenault, Frederick Douglass, Henry Louis Gates, Lewis Latimer, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Geoffrey Canada, Benjamin Mays, Wes Moore, Denzel Washington, Richard Parsons, Toure Roberts, and Daniel "Chappie" James. Did they go to college or not? What common threads did you find in their stories? Would you want to be like one of them...or even all of them? Whom did you most admire? ### </li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Make a list</strong> of what success looks like to you. Is it different from what a hero looks like and why? ###  What have you learned about the famous and the not so famous? How are lives changed by fame?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note how successful people usually acknowledge others who have made all the difference in their lives. Always say, "thank you."</p>

<h3>Topic 2: Why college, which college, and how to get there (Managing expectations with knowledge and planning for college)</h3>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> College graduation sets up an expectation for a better life. College today represents both the culmination of a successful path and the beginning of a successful life. Those with college degrees are more affluent and less likely to suffer from the negative consequences that are attributed to poverty.</p>

<p>Here is what we know about the benefits of college:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You are more secure economically. Those with college degrees in the last recession were more likely to be employed, stay employed when others were being laid off, and had higher wages.</li>
	<br>
	<li>On average, a college graduate makes about $300,000 more in a lifetime of working compared to someone with only a high school diploma.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You are likely to be happier. Those who are economically more stable (not wealthy necessarily, just comfortable) are living with less stress and have more time for better relationships.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You are likely to be healthier. The life span for those with college degrees is longer than for those without.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why might the benefits just described be true? Do they help you to think about the kind of life you might have after finishing college?</p>

<p>Dr. Sheila Peters at Fisk University describes other benefits of attending college. For example, she says that college provides the intangibles of being able to engage in small talk in an intellectual way. You know how to dress for an interview and you have a good resume. In addition, while you are waiting for that job interview, you can talk with the administrative assistant about more than the weather. You might even know something about the paintings hanging on the wall. You are more comfortable because, as a college graduate, you are used to that kind of conversation, and that's powerful.</p>

<p>What college offers is a set of key skills and relationships that go well beyond what students gain in high school. In many high schools you are mainly learning by <strong>rote</strong>, may have little homework compared to what you will be expected to do in college, and rarely are expected to take what you learn into broader contexts.</p>

<p>In college you will be asked to manage assignments on your own time, interpret information, engage in research, write extensively expressing your own views supported by evidence and logic, work with professors, <strong>collaborate</strong> with other students to complete assignments, and become self-determined. These are also valuable workplace skills. Employers look for solid communications skills, the ability to think logically, draw conclusions based on evidence, participate well with others, and work independently. College will offer opportunities to build these skills through class work, public speaking programs, or classes, and other resources. It is more demanding and likely to be completely different from what you might imagine as a high school student.</p>

<p>That is why it is so important to know enough about yourself to be able to make good choices about which schools to attend. Similarly you need to be thoughtful about choosing colleges based on YOUR strengths, interests, aptitudes, and learning styles, as well as geography, income, and the availability of financial assistance.What factors are you thinking about in making college choices &mdash; geography, cost, academic major, reputation, size, and friends? <strong>Make a list</strong> of what is important and put it in your priority order. ###</p> 

<p>A college event or fair at your high school is one of many tools, including The Fiske Guides, Princeton Review, books, and college websites that can help you explore the many types of schools that may interest you. Urban Prep's college event was described as an opportunity for the school's "best and brightest students" to meet deans and admissions officers from colleges and universities around the country. This was the students' opportunity to talk to representatives, find out what they looked for in applicants, ask questions, and gain a sense of what school might be a good fit for them. Later we see Krishaun at Fisk. Watch this video to see what happened at the event as well as what Krishaun thought about his choice of Fisk. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Aligning student strengths and interests with the right school can make all the difference." </em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What did Krishaun say was his career goal at the event? Why did Krishaun make the choice to attend Fisk University? What are some of the elements he considered important? How does this help you to think about your own choices, e.g., course of study, school size, and level of support that might be available?</blockquote>

<strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity: Student Learning Styles</strong>

<p>A key to college success and managing expectations is self-knowledge and the assurance that students are in the right schools that fit their learning styles and interests. Self-awareness can make time spent doing research on potential schools, attending college fairs, and visiting schools more effective and productive.</p>

<p><strong>Read the scenarios below</strong>. Find yourself in these types of students and consider the various options following high school. What sounds like the best fit for you? How else might you describe your goals and learning style? What led you to make the choice(s) you made? ###</p>

<p><strong>Loves Learning.</strong> <em>You love learning and being part of a community in which others do too.</em> That is the first clue that you are college material. You may not have admitted your love to others for fear of being considered geeky, but if in your mind you reveled in the ideas exchanged in your classes, then college could feel as if you're in a big candy store. You will be among many others who feel the way you do, and you'll have access to faculty who can feed your desire to learn and engage in new ideas. Either a small or mid-sized liberal arts college or a large university setting could be right for you.</p>

<p><strong>Under Challenged.</strong> <em>You were bored and not achieving at the level everyone else thought you could. </em>Did teachers and others tell you all the time how smart you were even when they said you weren't fulfilling your potential? Were you among those who found school easy? Maybe you did not like school because it was not challenging enough. You may want to look into a school that is not top-tier, but that has an honors program you can join as you show what you can do.</p>

<p><strong>Don't Need College (Now).</strong> <em>Your path may lead to being an artist or creative person who has to follow a passion unbound by <strong>pedagogy</strong>.</em> You don<sup>'</sup>t want to wait to do what you love and don't see that college is going to help you. You are a dancer, an artist, a filmmaker, a carpenter, and a fashion designer. You just want to start work. Perhaps you think you'll take some courses along the way, but don't need college full time, at least not now. But you may be a good fit for a school that specializes in your area of interest like New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, for example. Even people with creative interests need income and college degrees to get jobs; fortunately they can find jobs and schools that nourish their creativity.</p>

<p><strong>Hands-On Learner.</strong> <em>You learn best by doing and are practical in your interests.</em>Did you prefer the courses demanding the most practical approaches or that allowed you to work with your hands? Was taking action more important than reading or doing research in the library? You may be a student for whom a traditional college is not the right choice. Colleges that are clearly vocational in their focus and teach hands-on skills that can be used right away in defined workplaces are sometimes classified as technical colleges. Look at technical schools or community colleges. If looking at a for-profit school be sure it is accredited; do an Internet search to find out its reputation and identify any red flags.</p>

<p><strong>Adrift.</strong> <em>You are not yet sure whether college is right for you, or more important, if you are ready for college.</em> Do you feel pushed to go to school, but not quite focused enough to settle down to a course of study? Are you feeling that you don't have a sense of purpose? Are you looking for a purpose? While everyone else seems so assured about college goals, you want to enjoy other experiences before you take the plunge. You may have been derailed by a traumatic event. Your grades may not be great, and you wonder if you are worthy of the investment. You just feel wobbly about your situation. Again a community college will allow you to <strong>remediate</strong> needed skills as well as give you a chance to get your footing in a college setting and take the process step by step.</p>

<p><strong>Less-than-Dazzling Record.</strong> <em>Are your grades not what they should be?</em> Maybe you had a rough patch along the way. Perhaps your friends did not value education and you let yourself be pulled along with them, to the detriment of your grades. Maybe your grades are uneven: you are great in English, but terrible at math, and it shows in your grade point average (GPA) and college test scores such as the SAT or ACT. But you know you want to go to college. An excellent option for you may also be a community college or a school that is not top-tier. Once you are on more solid ground with a good track record you can think about transferring to a school more suited to your goals.</p>

<p><strong>Clear Career Path.</strong> <em>You have always known what you want to be when you grow up.</em> Have you always known you want to be a doctor, lawyer, executive, nurse, scientist, or teacher? All of these professions require a college degree and even an advanced degree. If you are clearly focused on and passionate about such a life path, then not only do you need college, but most likely you need one that will support that goal in particular. Look for colleges or universities with strong support programs (not majors) for pre-law or pre-med, for example, or research opportunities in the sciences or accelerated teaching certificates.</p>

<p><strong>No Resources.</strong> <em>You feel you cannot afford to go to college</em>. You want to go, but you and your family have no money for school. No one in your family has attended college, so it seems too difficult and out of reach for you. You may have family obligations already and cannot see how this can work for you. Financial aid is available, but you must do the work to find what is available.</p>

<p><strong>Returning Student.</strong> <em>You may be older than the traditional student and have family and home responsibilities to manage.</em> Perhaps, long ago, you felt that you were not ready for or did not need college, or now you're dead-ended in a career and need to develop new skills. You may be a veteran. You are part of a large and growing group for whom increasing resources are available. More than likely you are in the category of adult learner. You're over 25. Your time is precious. At some point you realize that to progress in your work or to move to a more lucrative field, you need a college degree or specialized training. You may need to start with a GED (General Education Degree) that will allow you to apply to college even without a traditional high school diploma. Community colleges are a good resource for you and cater to your needs both in flexibility and in course offerings that are job specific. They offer either an Associate's Degree or Certificate programs for specific job skills. Some offer GED programs to help you make that transition and many schools have special programs for veterans.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> You could fit into more than one category, or you may want to describe yourself in different ways. Which categories do Robert and Krishaun most likely fit into and why? (Clues: Did Robert and Krishaun have clear career goals?)</blockquote>

<p><strong>Which college is right for you?</strong> Take a look at the Sidebar on College Degrees to find out more about the kinds of college degrees that are available &mdash; Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, and beyond. What degree matches your job seeking and career goals &mdash; and what can you afford? Put this information together with what you have already learned about yourself from figuring out what student learning style best describes you. Now you're ready to start thinking about what colleges might work best for you. Think broadly. Make an initial list of colleges to look into. ###</p>

<h4>Sidebar: College Degrees <a href="LINK"><strong>(LINK)</strong></a></h4>

<p>Types of degrees or programs to consider as you look ahead to schooling after high school graduation.</p>
<ul>
	<li>An <strong>Associate's</strong> degree (AA) requires two years of work for a degree in general studies or one specialized in a profession, such as Business Information Systems or Health Care Management.</li>
	<br>
	<li>A <strong>certificate program</strong> does not grant a degree nor have the rigorous expectations of a degree-granting program, but certifies that the student has taken course work leading to a level of proficiency in a stated area.</li>
	<br>
	<li>A <strong>Bachelor's</strong> degree commonly requires four years of study or the equivalent in credits. It may be a BA (Bachelor of Arts) or a BS (Bachelor of Science), depending on the concentration and offerings of the college.</li>
	<br>
	<li>A <strong>Master's</strong>degree(MA) is a graduate degree earned after a BA/BS and may be a year or two, or the equivalent in credits, depending on the program. It is a specialization or concentration in a particular subject or field. For example, an MBA is a Master in Business Administration, an MFA is a Master of Fine Arts, an MSW is a Master in Social Work, and an MPA is a Master of Public Administration. One can also earn an MA in history or biology or math. An MA is usually required before or as part of earning the doctorate, with variations from school to school.</li>
	<br>
	<li>A <strong>Doctorate</strong> is considered a "terminal degree," meaning it is the highest degree you can earn in the field of your choosing. A doctoral degree can be general such as a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.); or specific such as a JD, Juris Doctor (law degree), an MD, Doctor of Medicine, or an Ed.D., Doctor of Education.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give yourself enough time while you are in high school to find the schools that interest you and that seem to fit your learning style and goals. Here is a list of key activities you can also do in high school to help you get into the college of your choice:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be sure you have great grades. This will be especially true your last two years, but it all counts in the end. Ask for extra help from teachers if you need it. (Do this in college too; it is what teachers are paid to do!)</li>
	<br>
	<li>READ. Read volumes of books, magazines, news articles &mdash; whatever interests you. Doing so will build your vocabulary skills for the SAT/ACT tests. You will also become a better writer and be more prepared for interviews.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Engage in the right activities &mdash; not to the <strong>detriment</strong> of your schoolwork or health but enough to show that you are a leader, innovator, and caring person through projects you do for your high school or in your church or community. Find clubs or opportunities to learn more about your planned career. All of these help you to gain experiences that you can use in personal statements and interviews.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Have a part-time job. This shows how responsible you are and helps you save money for college.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Build relationships with adults in high school and in your jobs and activities so they will be happy to write those glowing letters of recommendation you will need.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Find a program through your school or public library that will prepare you for the SAT/ACT tests. You'll discover "tricks of the trade" to help you do well on standardized tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are very similar to the skills and activities you will use in college to search for a job and be launched on your career. Get into the habit now.</p>

<p><strong>Information: Writing the essay for your college application</strong></p>
<p>The steps to being admitted to the college of your choice include completing a college application and writing an essay that will convince them you are the right student for their college.</p>

<p>As you prepare to write the all-important college essays to the schools you've chosen, think about how you see yourself. What are <em>your</em> goals? What have you achieved academically, socially, in sports, and in serving the community? This is one of the places where all those things you have been doing while in high school become important. What obstacles have you overcome? Write these down. Make it comprehensive and then you can select the ideas that work for individual colleges. ###</p> 

<p>Your essay needs to be personal and compelling. Expect to write several drafts that should be reviewed by people who know you as well as those who are excellent writers. It has to be your own voice and work. What are the <strong>anecdotes</strong> in your life that best describe who you are and how you came to be that way? No one can or should write it for you. It is YOUR story after all &mdash; about what has made all the difference in YOUR life.</p>

<p>Evan Lewis, Krishaun's Urban Prep adviser, talks to him about writing the essay for his college application. He says the essay has to "communicate who you are now, who you were then, and who you want to be in the future &mdash; and what is the evolution of Krishaun." They discuss Krishaun's past when he believed fighting was his lifestyle. Lewis advises Krishaun that every day he is fighting a battle that will determine whether or not he is able to live the life he envisions for himself. He advises Krishaun to be committed to his dream of success. <a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Identifying your goals and dreams can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What does Evan Lewis mean by saying Krishaun needs to "fight a battle" every day to live his dream? Think about your past, present, and future. How will you describe yourself on your college essay &mdash; and tell what you plan for your future? How strongly are you committed to your dream of college and success? What can you say to convince the college of your commitment?</blockquote>

<p><strong>Advice on doing the all-important college essay.</strong> By Zaragoza Guerra, college admissions consultant on <a href="http://www.GetIntoCollege.com">www.GetIntoCollege.com</a>.</p>

<p>It's mid-July, and I'm sure most soon-to-be seniors are enjoying a much needed respite from school work, term papers, and standardized testing. But the halcyon days of summer, unfortunately, will eventually come to an end. It's not a bad idea to get started on the main <a href="http://info.getintocollege.com/blog/bid/267878/Common-Application-Announces-New-Essay-Prompts-College-Admission-Experts-Reaction">Common Application essay</a> &mdash; get it out of the way before it has to compete for your attention against tests, papers, extracurricular activities, and any supplemental application essay questions, most of which get published August 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p>Where does one even begin when tackling the Common App essay? Is there anything in particular colleges want to see? Let's start with the first essay prompt:</p>

<p><em>Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.</em></p>

<p>Holy <em>background-or-story-so-central-to-their-identity</em> Batman! Do you have to have lived Bruce Wayne's life, with its dramatic highs and lows, to answer this question? Absolutely not! Here's your guide for breaking down this prompt:</p>
<ol>
	<li><em><strong>Know your audience.</strong></em> Remember, this essay is going to be read by an academic community's gatekeeper, someone wanting to know <em><a href="http://www.getintocollege.com/why-college-coach/finding-the-right-fit">how well you'd fit in at his school</a></em>. When narrowing down your topic or choosing your story, think about how it relates to you as a scholar, a leader, someone who overcomes obstacles, a person with a particular talent, or a person who interacts with the community.</li>
	<br>
	<li><em><strong>Highlight key words.</strong></em> Don't let the words "background" or "story" distract you. The key word here is "identity" &mdash; <em>yours</em>, to be exact. This prompt is all about letting your reader know about <em>you</em>, how <em>you</em> see yourself, what informs <em>your</em> actions. The background and story here are important, yes, but only insomuch as they are a jumping off point from which to get to the heart of your essay: <em>you.</em></li>
	<br>
	<li><em><strong>Illustrate your story.</strong></em> You can tell someone until you are blue in the face that you're funny, but until s/he laughs at one of your jokes, s/he'll have a hard time believing you. Don't just <em>tell</em> your reader you are such and such.  <em>Show</em> it through your <strong>anecdotes</strong>! Has your identity manifested itself in some way, through actions or drive? If so, show your reader.</li>
	<br>
	<li><em><strong>State your goals.</strong></em> Imagine you are Superman. Well, Superman is Superman because he has a purpose; otherwise, he'd be just another strong man with a cape. While his story is unique &mdash; how many other kids from Kansas can say they fell to earth in a meteor shower? &mdash; It is the story's impact on Superman's outlook and mission that is so compelling. Let your reader know how you see things, what contributions you've already made in the world, and what you're hoping to do in the future. Be careful not to sound <strong>haughty </strong>or <strong>pretentious</strong>.</li>
	<br>
	<li><em><strong>Avoid wrestling with inner demons.</strong></em> Your personal statement is not a diary entry or reality show, and a <a href="http://www.getintocollege.com/why-college-coach/understand-the-admissions-process">college admissions committee</a> is not your therapist. Don't cloud an admission officer's mind with doubts about your ability to handle the pressures of college or its social environs. Focus on your strengths!</li>
</ol>

<p>Zeroing in on a story that screams "you" from among a lifetime of stories might seem daunting, but don't let the challenge scare you away from choosing this essay prompt. If you remember your target audience and their interest in hearing your story, you'll be better able to hone your topic into a successful personal statement &mdash; one that focuses on how your identity will help you make strong academic or social contributions to your prospective college. If your story is a bumpy one, you need to demonstrate how you have overcome <strong>adversity</strong>, learned lessons, and matured.</p>

<h3>Topic 3: Financing college</h3>

<strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity:</strong> 
<p>Money is often the scariest aspect of planning for college. You should prepare a personal budget now while you are in high school that allows some savings for college. Notice that a budget forces you to make difficult choices &mdash; college fund or new sneakers or a special hairdo. Keep a notebook on spending for two weeks. ###  At the end of two weeks see how <strong>prudent</strong> you have been and how well you are able to fit your spending to your budget. What strategies can you use to manage your spending? Choose a budget buddy. Both of you should set a savings goal for something you want <em>and for your college fund</em>. See who does the best and encourage or remind one another of your goals. ###</p> 

<p><strong>Information:</strong> The money question applies to pretty much everybody. Money is an area people hesitate to talk about and yet has huge implications. Studies indicate, for example, that black students tend to leave college with the most student loan debt &mdash; more than $25,000. This was certainly true for both Robert and Krishaun. You need money to go to the college of your choice and remain in school to complete your degree. Learning about financial resources can save you lots of money &mdash; and perhaps save your education. Learning about and managing money becomes essential to achieving your education. Done right, it becomes an essential part of that education.</p>

<p>How to pay for college is important for all students. Money will be a key factor in whether you feel you can go to college as well as make it through to graduation. Research and planning are essential. Another factor to consider as you begin to search for the right school &mdash; <em>which ones offer the best value for your money</em>. As we've mentioned before, you also need to begin saving money for college yourself.</p>

<p>Students who will be the first in their family to attend college, or whose families do not have a lot of money, may have the least information about the college application process and available resources. If this is you, you may need more time to find the right school and learn what it takes to get in.</p>

<p>Financing college is often a key obstacle to students' achieving a college degree. If students are dedicated and really want to go, the funds can generally be found. Both Robert and Krishaun received financial aid to help them attend college, and both sought help from financial advisers. In this clip, we sit in on Robert's meeting with a financial aid adviser at Lake Forest College. Before he can graduate, Robert must pay a balance of $9,603. The adviser says that Robert already has $40,000 in student loan debt; he is hoping Robert can find other resources to cover the balance. Robert says he has "lots of regrets" about his freshman and sophomore years. He wished he'd had better advice so his loan debt would be lower. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>,<em>"Securing financial support and understanding your financial aid package early can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What lessons did you learn from this meeting? What might Robert have done so that his loan debt would be lower as he was preparing to graduate? Thinking ahead to your time in college, what financial resources are you planning to use? What are some ways that you can earn money?</blockquote>

<p>You need to find out about financial aid and talk to financial advisers at schools you are considering. ### A resource list is provided at the end of this chapter. For U.S. citizens, federal funds are available, usually in the form of Pell grants, student loans, work-study programs, deferred tuition programs (such as AmeriCorps), or outright scholarships tied to specific subjects or geography. The most important thing you need to do is to fill out the <strong>FAFSA</strong> (Free Application for Federal Student Aid).The good news is that, according to the media, more federal funds are being made available to finance your education. The bad news is that getting access to that money is a complex process. The media have also reported on this as well as the complexities of filling out the <strong>FAFSA</strong>. (Be aware that you are <em>not</em> eligible for federal government support if you are not a U.S. citizen. Some states, but not all, will allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in public colleges at resident rates.)</p>

<p>A wonderful new tool will help you with this process. Called "Get Schooled," it is brought to you by MTV:(<a href="https://getschooled.com/dashboard?tag_group=find-money-for-college">Find Money For College</a>). Check it out. Write down what you learn ####</p>

<p>To be eligible for federal Pell grants, loans, or even campus-based aid, you <em>must have filled out the FAFSA</em>. In fact, it is a good idea to do so even if you are lucky enough not to need financial aid. Your family's federal tax return for the previous year is required as part of financial aid applications and even for some government sponsored scholarships based on proven financial need. It is a problem for you if your family has not filed income tax returns. Some public colleges will enroll you and even find private funding sources for you, but in most cases you have to be able and willing to submit the FAFSA form. If a crisis such as illness in the family or loss of a job occurs, you must be in the system to appeal for support, even if right now you could pay the whole bill. It is best to work with the financial aid office; the advisers are trained to guide and counsel you on how to obtain aid.</p>

<p>An organization called QuestBridge believes it is important for students from low-income families to receive four-year scholarships to give them assurance they can complete their degrees. It matches up students with a high level of academic achievement in high school with top-tier colleges and universities.</p>

<p>Taking out credit union loans is a good strategy. Private donors, clubs, and fraternal organizations also offer funds, and some may be available to those without green cards or who are not yet naturalized citizens. Krishaun also received money from Urban Prep for recruiting and supporting its students to attend Fisk. Some employers offer tuition support if the schooling relates to a particular job. State and city public college systems are economical for local students and often truly stellar. What is important is to research the various ways that college costs can be reduced and apply to diverse sources.</p>

<p>You need to know that many students and families also have misconceptions about college costs. Their first thought is that the price they see is what they will pay. The reality is that just like a new car, this is the sticker price. The final cost may ultimately be far less once financial aid is factored in. At the same time, families do not often plan for costs that begin to accrue even in the application process while you are still in high school. These can include application fees, a visit to the campus, and doctor visits for a physical exam or any needed shots (measles vaccine is required). Once accepted by a college you may need:</p>
<ul>
	<li>New clothes depending on the climate in which the school is located</li>
	<li>Bedding and other household items for a dorm room</li>
	<li>Health insurance if the student is not on the parent's plan</li>
	<li>Student fees</li>
	<li>Meal plans</li>
	<li>Books and school supplies</li>
	<li>Required deposit for a dorm room</li>
	<li>Funds for transportation to college</li>
	<li>Laptop computer (to track assignments/time commitments, take notes, conduct research, link to course resources, and prepare class assignments)</li>
	<li>Cell phone</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to add up the items here and see what you could need over and above tuition for college expenses. ###</p>

<p>For each item, think about a source of funding for it. Robert mentions, for example, that bus fare to college was the one contribution that his grandmother was able to make for him. This may be why a summer and/or a part-time campus work-study job could be essential. (They also build your resume.)</p>

<p>Understanding various costs, planning wisely, and spending modestly are critical as both Robert and Krishaun discovered. Both young men have money anxieties throughout their college years. At the end of college, both Robert and Krishaun owed significant amounts of money in student loans. Their financial aid officers, with whom they had good relationships, helped them as much as they could. Without a doubt, the young men could have planned better and been more <strong>frugal</strong>; Krishaun, for example, could have found more part-time jobs. Working for an AmeriCorps service organization after he graduated from college will help Robert to reduce his loans as well as meet his personal goals.</p>

<p>What stumbling blocks and costs may be particularly difficult for you and your family? Money is one of the hardest things families have to discuss but it is hugely important. Talk with your parents, adviser, a credit counselor, or even a friend who is good with money. Be realistic.</p>

<p>For many, the best option may be a community college. Typically they are publicly funded, meaning subsidized, so expenses are reasonable. They accept students from local high schools and communities and know intimately the strengths and weaknesses of local school systems. They offer <strong>remedial</strong> courses, often in math and language skills, and offer more support to help students adjust to college culture.</p>

<p>Explore local community colleges, and public and private colleges and universities; include historically black colleges and universities. Keep in mind, however, that private colleges may not offer enough financial aid for some students to be able to attend &mdash; as Lake Forest and Fisk did initially for Robert and Krishaun. Look at the resource list at the end of this chapter to find ideas. ###</p>

<p>Online schools and courses are available. It is important to know how to learn in an online environment; it can be a way to start school or to study when you are working full time. However, you have to be very careful in choosing online schools or courses as not all are of equal quality. You will also miss the opportunity to engage with classmates and faculty in ways that will mimic the kinds of relationships and behaviors you will need for the workplace. You don't even have to get out of your pajamas. And while that sounds great, it does not prepare you to dress for success! Look for accreditation as one clue of quality.</p>

<h4>Sidebar: Accredited Colleges <a href="LINK">(LINK)</a></h4>

<p>Federal financial aid is given only to schools that meet accreditation standards and students would be wise to focus on these schools. Regional organizations review colleges and universities on a variety of measures, including governance, financial stability, and most important, academic outcomes. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the goal of accreditation is to "assure that institutions of higher education meet acceptable standards of quality." A list of accredited colleges meeting federal standards can be found at <a href="http://ope.edu.gov/accreditation/">ope.ed.gov/accreditation/</a>.</p>

<strong>Homework:</strong> <p>Use the Internet to research colleges (5-10) that interest you. ### Why these schools? Here are some ways to think about your choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Think back to the type of learner you are.</li>
	<li>What degree you are seeking and how large or small a school you want to attend.</li>
	<li>Now factor in costs.</li>
	<li>You can use the list of accredited colleges for ideas and then look on the colleges' individual websites.</li>
	<li>Schools can be in state or out of state. (Some out-of-state schools adjust finances according to student need, but students also have to plan for travel costs.)</li>
	<li>Do you know schools based on friends, family, or reputation?</li>
	<li>Your research should include what kinds of reputations the schools have and whether they are accredited. Search the Internet to find articles that may send up red flags or affirm the choice you are thinking about.</li>
	<li>Note whether they are for-profit or nonprofit. You may want to be especially wary of for-profit schools/colleges, and to know their reputations <em>before</em> paying.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now make a new list of schools to consider,given all this new information. ###</p>

<p><strong>Personal Lifelong Learning: </strong>This is a good time to start a personal journal. Journaling can actually be a stress reliever while you are in high school, as well as help you to know yourself better. Choose an online journal or a written journal. You can begin by listing what you have learned so far about readiness for college. What are your personal expectations for yourself? What do you feel others expect from you, and are the two aligned &mdash; that is, do your personal goals match family goals for instance? Whom do you admire and why? What do you see that you may have to work on, whether a value or a subject matter, or a personal attribute (like patience or time management)? What would be a game plan to do that work? All these things and more can go into your "college preparation journal." Note that successful people report that keeping a journal of some kind is useful as a lifetime skill. ### </p>

<p><strong>What should you take away from this chapter?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>You have to begin to understand who you are and create <em>your own </em>expectations.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You should talk to your family about what you want and be sure you are all on the same page together. Build a support team to help you get from high school to college.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You should have some role models and inspiration to keep you going; a buddy who also wants to go to college can encourage your efforts.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You should appreciate why college is worth the effort.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You have to research schools and figure out which ones will support your dreams and goals.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You have to be prepared to complete the necessary applications &mdash; for admission to a college including your personal essay, and the FAFSA form for financial assistance.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Having a plan to pay for college is critical and you need to do the work to uncover financial aid. You also need to understand your own responsibilities including possibly having a job and saving money; budgeting can help you make smart choices.</li>

<h2>Chapter Two: Career Paths and Academic Majors</h2>

<p>After money, the next thing you and your family will try to figure out when considering college is your academic major. A very common question for students graduating from high school is, "What will you major in at college?" The way college works may not be at all what you expect. This chapter offers thoughts about career paths, choosing a college major, and good grades; it explains what a liberal arts curriculum is and how academic disciplines work. It also covers what you gain from majors as they relate to careers and the world of work. Getting a job is the reason most of you give for why you want to go to college.</p>

<p>Indeed, a college degree has a definite economic impact. According to a College Board report:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Median annual earnings of bachelor's degree recipients with no advanced degree working full time in 2011 were $56,500, <em>$21,100 more</em> than median earnings of high school graduates.</li>
	<li>Individuals with some college but no degree earned 14 percent more than high school graduates working full time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Building skills and gaining knowledge through the right set of courses can make all the difference in your experience of college and launching a career.</p>

<h3>Topic 1: Career paths and expectations</h3>

<strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity:</strong>

<p><strong><em>Make four lists:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>(1) Things you love to do</li>
	<li>(2) Things you are good at</li>
	<li>(3) Things you are not good at and find hard to do</li>
	<li>(4) Things you hate doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each category, you should consider activities in areas such as school, friends, family, athletics, faith, hobbies, interests, talents, and part-time jobs. ### </p>

<p><em>Now look for correlations:</em> what are the things you love to do and are good at? What are the ones you are good at but hate to do? (These can be traps because people will ask you to do what you are good at even though you hate the work.) What about the things you both hate and are not good at &mdash; would this be a good career choice? The winning list is what you love to do AND are good at. Keep this list in mind as you think about careers and even courses or college majors. It can save lots of pain later on.</p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> <em>This will be you</em> &mdash; count on it. When students start college, and even while they are in high school, they generally have a ready response to a question about what they want to study in college and what they plan to do with their degrees. They may say they are pre-med or pre-law, or interested in accounting or business. Then life happens. The pre-med student discovers an aversion to blood, the pre-law student decides that law firms are boring, and the accounting student hates math. And then over a lifetime of work bigger changes occur. Recessions happen. Relationships come and go. Industries rise and fall. Hurricanes devastate neighborhoods. Technologies are created and then replaced by newer technologies. <em>Your major will not determine the rest of your life.</em> What you think you will do as you exit high school may not be the job you choose as you exit college. Just as you have changed in high school you will continue to grow and change in college as your world view expands.</p>

<p>Robert began college with very specific views on what he wanted to study and why. He entered Lake Forest College intending to be a biology major. One reason he chose Lake Forest was that a high percentage of students ended up going to medical school; he wanted to become a doctor. What are you currently thinking that <em>you</em> might study in college?</p>

<p>Robert had a partial scholarship to Lake Forest and needed to maintain a strong grade point average (GPA). Early on, however, he discovers that both biology and chemistry, subjects in which he needed to do really well, are a challenge for him. He may not have the academic background to understand the material, or the courses may not fit his current learning style, or they may just not be as interesting or appealing as he first thought they would be.</p>

<p>Doing poorly in one or more subjects would trip up his advancement through college and could cost him his scholarships. He needed to make a change. Talking to an adviser early on was key to restructuring his academic plan. In Robert's case his adviser and chemistry professor, Dr. Lori Del Negro, made all the difference to his progress and potential success in college.</p>

<p>Watch the video to find out how Robert's major and career direction changed &mdash; and how he felt about it. In the video, Dr. Del Negro says that Robert has hit the point at which it would be "difficult for him to receive a passing grade" in chemistry. He also needs to drop biology, meaning that he can no longer pursue a pre-med course at Lake Forest. Despite the course failures, Dr. Del Negro praises Robert for being "really responsible about getting in to see people, finding help available, and finding the resources available." <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Developing greater awareness, remaining flexible about future goals, and building skills can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What do both Robert and Dr. Del Negro say about Robert's change to his new double major (history and American studies)? What were Dr. Del Negro's ultimate college goals for Robert &mdash; which she thought would "open him up to a high-paying job"? For himself, what did Robert say was his ultimate goal? What do you think about the end-of-college goals both of them stated? Did they surprise you? What might be the right goals for you?</blockquote>

<p>Think about when you had a goal and someone helped you find a way to achieve it. What happened? It is important to use advisers and professors for guidance. List teachers, advisers, coaches, family members, or others that you could ask for guidance in Robert's situation.###</p> 

<p><strong>Story Sharing:</strong> Whom do you know who has had different types of jobs or careers in his or her lifetime? Talk to them. Ask what skills they have used consistently along the way. What did they wish they had known or studied in college? ###</p> 

<p>Go back to the previous chapter and revisit the bios of famous people who have progressed through many phases. President Barack Obama, for example, has been a community organizer, college professor, senator, and president. Think about pop icons who have gone to college and now have more than one business enterprise, e.g., Sean John (P. Diddy) Combs, Magic Johnson, and J. Lo. What new skills did they have to develop along their paths to success?</p> 

<p>During the course of their college years, both Robert and Krishaun changed their ideas about their career paths and their majors. What changes have you made regarding your own career goals from the time you were a little kid up to now? It is important to know that being open-minded about your course of study will keep you connected to your interests, skills, and talents &mdash; and what you can achieve with them. You are more likely to succeed if you are using your strengths and real interests. The push toward a specific career path is often premature, usually made in the mistaken belief that you need to learn specific skill sets to grab the jobs available <em>right now</em> such as in technology, engineering, and other science related fields.</p> 

<p>But then we forget four key things.</p> 

<p><strong>One</strong> is that not everyone is equipped with or interested in those particular skill sets. You have different learning styles, changing interests, and varied aptitudes. A system that drives everyone in a particular direction will leave out some who have gifts of their own to offer.</p> 

<p><strong>Second</strong>, if you look at any industry, even an accounting firm, you will find people with many jobs: those who manage human resources and training, those who are support teams for executives, and those who do sales and marketing. There may be a legal team and an operations function. Companies utilize a wide range of talents and skills that have nothing to do with their primary business, but are essential to their success. Our economy needs a wide range of skill sets across and within industries including communications, research, and sales. Those skills can be gained from an English or history major, but skills are also honed on the job itself. Experience becomes the teacher, building on skills learned in the classroom and adapted to the way the firm itself does business. <em>Employers seek smart students with top grades who demonstrate they will learn fast on the job.</em></p> 

<p><strong>Third</strong>, people change. What seems like a passion at one stage of life may not fit another stage as interests grow, bodies age, and new horizons are discovered. Most people will have at least four jobs/careers over a lifetime. Some claim as many as 15 jobs, with the lion's share in the first few years of work life when you are still in self-discovery mode. The 40s mid-life moment seems to be another time when people seek change; and then late in life we may want to pursue a passion that has been lurking in our minds for decades. A good education allows for those shifts without going back to school every time unless the field requires it.</p> 

<p><strong>Finally</strong>, we cannot read the tea leaves. Someone with a marketing major 12 years ago would not have known that social media would totally change advertising and marketing. Who knows what discoveries are going on in someone's garage that will be the next game changer? Yet, over time the colleges that graduated &mdash; or inspired &mdash; or provided resources to the game changers and leaders of today have taught basically the same subject areas for more than 150 years. Course content has changed with the times.</p> 

<p><strong>List new fields</strong> that you may have heard of that have emerged in the past few years such as online marketing, biogenetics, and data mining. ###</p> 

<p>But remember that jobs have stayed the same in terms of the need to communicate with others, solve problems, and promote ideas. Make a list of both the general and career-specific skills you might need in these three careers: advertising copywriter, financial analyst, and math teacher. Some skills will be the same for all three. And some will be specific to the career. ### (Note that you may have to talk to people in these or similar jobs to find out what exactly they do, or you can use the library or online resources.)</p> 

<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Describe what you know about the careers you are considering. Do you know people who are employed in those fields? Talk to them about their work. How did they learn about the existence of their fields? What ideas can they share about the course of study that helped them to work in that field? ###</p> 

<h3>Topic 2: Academic majors and career goals</h3>

<strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity:</strong> 
<p>How will you respond to the question, "What will you do with your major in (English, history, or another)?" You can consider a beginning job as well as think big about your potential for success. Here are two examples of corporate executives: American Express' (a financial institution) CEO Kenneth Chenault has a degree in history while Merck's (a pharmaceutical company) CEO Kenneth Frazier has a degree in political science. Where they began in college is very different from their current career highs. Just be aware that you have plenty of time to find your own career; do not feel pressured to make premature decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> It is important to understand that your college major and later career are not necessarily bound together. Playing to your strengths can be a good approach to find work that will yield good results.</p>

<p>A good beginning in college is often a liberal arts education. The advantage of liberal arts is that you develop a range of skills that will serve you well for the rest of your life. Some courses focus on reading and writing while others expose you to different methods of doing research to prove points; each subject area requires different analytical and critical thinking skills. Such an education when coupled with work and life experiences helps to shape a person who is capable of becoming a leader, who can meet the demands of employers, and who creatively approaches any challenges in the workplace.</p>

<h4>Sidebar: Liberal Arts Course of Study <a href="LINK">(LINK)</a></h4>

<p>Students often seek admission to a school that offers a <strong>liberal arts</strong> course of study. It covers several significant fields including the arts and humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. Read what each of these is and think about how each relates to many, many career choices.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>social sciences</strong> generally relate to the study of human experience, society, and social behavior, including majors like psychology, sociology, criminology, anthropology, history, political science, and economics. They are useful in any career that requires interaction with or understanding of others.</li>
	<br>
	<li>The <strong>humanities</strong> are generally the subjects that relate to humans as intellectual and creative beings. These typically include literature, languages (English as well as all others), philosophy, and the arts such as fine arts, music, and dance, as well as the histories of these subjects. These are also a window into human behavior, but also good for fields requiring communication skills and creativity ranging from law to advertising.</li>
	<br>
	<li>The <strong>sciences</strong> comprise a course of study of the physical or material world, explored through a rigorous and systematic process. Subjects include biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering, and computer science. For those with a scientific mind these are useful for everything from creating new medicines to marketing.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Some courses or majors cross over several of these categories and are called <strong>interdisciplinary</strong>; they might include social psychology, for example, which crosses sociological issues with those of psychology. Interdisciplinary describes how most of us work every day. Most jobs require several kinds of knowledge, which is why colleges make students take courses in all the disciplines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make a list</strong> of college academic departments or subjects that you think sound interesting. ###</p>

<p><strong>Look at a college catalog</strong> for descriptions of the courses in those departments. Make a note of those that interest you. ###</p>

<p>Think about Robert and Krishaun's career goals, how they approached them in college, and the majors they selected. Robert majored in history and American studies, while Krishaun majored in psychology. Robert learned about other cultures and Krishaun studied human behavior. Both majors will be useful in the work they envision doing, when they finish college and long term. Here is what Robert's adviser, Dr. Lori Del Negro said about how skills in any major can be useful in a variety of ways:</p>

<p>"So what it (history/American studies major) opens up is the ability to think critically about texts and I think in today's world that means a lot because a lot of what's happening in social media is text-based. It's like how is this conversation unfolding, what are the factors at play, can we analyze what's influencing how something is translating over time."</p>

<p>Robert's two majors play to his strengths in the sense that he's great at networking and connecting people, "just sort of putting lots of resources together and making connections that might not otherwise get made."</p>

<p>The idea is that Robert will have broad skills in interpreting various factors that affect culture and how that information is passed to others. He could be involved in market analysis or business strategic planning. You can imagine tracking cultural influences and how companies are perceived in popular media.</p>

<p>Are you likely to be taking any courses that may not seem directly relevant to your hoped for career, but may be useful, for example, in learning how to do research, analyze information, or communicate better? Be sure you take some courses that build your skills in public speaking, computing, and data assessment; these can be very diverse and include sociology, for example.</p>

<p>Here are some realistic goals in preparing for and beginning college and ultimately finding a job to start your career path:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Study hard and do <em>really</em> well in your area of interest to maintain a strong grade point average (GPA).</li>
	<br>
	<li>Check out the work world through internships, work-study, service, experiential programs, actual jobs, contact with others in the workplace, and reading about trends in industries.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Build and be able to discuss and show wide-ranging skills including communications, creative problem solving, research, computer or technical literacy, human interaction, and time management.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a blog that offers some perspective on the connection between what you do in college and your success after: "The Top Four Things Students Can Do to Fit into the Workplace." <a href="http://bit.ly/1opVfe3">http://bit.ly/1opVfe3</a></p>

<p>Work, internships, and volunteer opportunities are all ways that you can test your interests and skills in a situation that you are considering as a major or career. Volunteerism is also a way to give back to the community. In this video Krishaun is at Thresh House of Fisk University helping students in local neighborhood schools with their homework. Krishaun compares the experience to his own elementary school education. He says that he never had a person in college tutor him or tell him about college. He hopes to pass on the idea that the kids should "take advantage of opportunities and find better ways of doing things instead of always the rough or tough way." Watch the video to find out what Krishaun's mentorship work means to him. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a> <em>"Gaining experience through volunteering, internships, and work opportunities, ideally in what you want to do, can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What are some ways you are taking advantage of opportunities that could help you to enter and graduate from college? How do you think Krishaun's volunteer work will benefit him? How does it fit his ideas about a job at Urban Prep following his graduation from Fisk?Research programs at your school or in your town that may offer volunteer or internship opportunities. ###</blockquote> 

<strong>Homework</strong>

<p>Visit the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Handbook website to find out how many different jobs are related to your fields of interest. It is amazing how few people have a sense of the range of options open to them. We tend to think of a few basic categories like medicine, teaching, business, or law. The site is <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/home.htm">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/home.htm</a>. Clicking on any category will give job titles, descriptions, education needed (usually college), and base salary information. ###</p>

<p>Using the library, research your particular field(s) of interest. If you are in college you can find information in your college career services office; otherwise use your school or public library. What are the skills needed for the field? What are the pay scales? Use this website: <a href="http://about.salary.com/SalaryWizard/LayoutScripts/Swzl_NewSearch.aspx">http://about.salary.com/SalaryWizard/LayoutScripts/Swzl_NewSearch.aspx</a> . What kinds of organizations are involved: for profit or not for profit, multinational, or entrepreneurial, or large or small? ###</p>

<p>What do people do in this work? Who are the well-known names in the field? Look for publications that focus on a particular field of interest such as <em>Ad Age</em> for people in the advertising industry. Look for success stories in publications like <em>Black Enterprise.</em> Who might you know locally? ###</p>

<p>Choose any large company like American Express (financial institution) or Merck (pharmaceuticals). Look them up on the Internet to find out what jobs people have and the types of jobs the companies are recruiting for. ###</p>

<p>Look at the biographies of notable people like CEOs Kenneth Chenault, American Express; Roger Ferguson, TIAA-CREF; Ursula Burns, Xerox; or Kenneth Frasier at Merck. What can you learn about their career paths and professional activities? ###</p>

<p>Write an essay on your field of interest. Why is it a good fit for you? ### You may find your ideas useful in later cover letters for job applications.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Lifelong Learning:</strong> Every semester review courses to find out what skills and information you are gaining that may be useful to your fields of interest in particular or the workplace in general. Look for skills like research, working in teams, solving problems, meeting deadlines, being creative, or organizing material. Any course will offer some of these skills or additional ones. You should be able to discuss them...perhaps in an interview with a potential employer.</p>

<p>Make an appointment to see an adviser at least twice a semester and assess how you are doing. Then decide if you need to make any changes to your plans or are eligible for enrichment programs or other opportunities. A good mentor on campus or an adviser can make all the difference to success in college. ###</p> 

<p>Keep a list of phone numbers and email addresses for key supportpeople and stay in contact with them. These may include a coach, adviser, employer, pastor, dean, or professor(s). ###</p> 

<strong>What should you take away from this chapter?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Think about your strengths and interests so you can identify college majors in which you can succeed.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Research the wide range of fields open to you and understand what kinds of course work or degrees you may need to enter those fields.</li>
</ul>
It will help to understand that most people's lives are not a straight line and that what will be important will be big skills like writing and thinking that will carry you through many jobs and careers over a lifetime.

<h2>Chapter Three: Networks, Relationships, and Resources</h2>

<p>It has been said that those with the greatest <em>networks</em> have the greatest <em>net worth!</em> Look at books like Leslie Grossman's <em>Link Out</em> and Porter Gale's <em>Your Network is Your Net Worth: Unlock the Hidden Power of Connections for Wealth, Success, and Happiness in the Digital Age</em>. ### College is a place to build key support networks and to use resources that will make all the difference in achieving your goals. Your network is a group of people you can count on to provide support and good advice. It should include people from different areas of your life such as family, school, faith, sports, and work.</p>

<p>In this handbook, you will learn the importance of creating supportive relationships with people that can help you to practice effective behaviors and achieve positive goals. Relationships, as the <em>All the Difference</em> film shows again and again, can make all the difference. Building and maintaining a support team or network starts in high school and goes on for your lifetime.</p>

<p>School is naturally a place that encourages and values questioning. Inquiry is the basis on which a faculty's work is built, so they welcome questions and the students who ask them. When you ask or answer questions in class you are speaking their language &mdash; and connecting with them in a positive way.</p>

<p>Learn how to approach and listen to the people who can help you, beginning with your teachers. In one of their meetings, Dr. Sheila Peters (academic adviser) explains to Krishaun why knowing and talking to his professors will improve his college and life success. She suggests that he stop by once a month to see each of his instructors &mdash; to tell them he likes a particular activity or to ask for help. She tells him that it makes all the difference to let them know you are interested and that you care. This is also a good strategy to use on the job with your boss.</p>

<p>This is a life lesson in building relationships or networking. And it can make all the difference.</p>

<h3>Topic 1: Networking</h3>

<p>One of the key aspects of networking is knowing how to get started. You can start a conversation with something as simple as a comment on the weather and then introduce yourself. Depending on the person you are talking to and the situation you may then want to launch into what is called an "elevator speech" &mdash; what you could say about yourself between the first and 25<sup>th</sup> floor of an elevator ride. You always want to be prepared, whether you meet someone at an event at your school or on the check-out line at a grocery store, to tell your story to someone who might be helpful. Maybe they can help you get into college, obtain a job interview, or help you learn more about a career that interests you. However <em>always</em> remember to ask the other person about themselves. That will impress them the most!</p>

<p>Here is a link to a website at the career office of West Virginia University that gives some excellent pointers and "elevator speech" examples for students like you. <a href="http://careerservices.wvu.edu/students/build-it/interviewing/developing-your-elevator-speech">http://careerservices.wvu.edu/students/build-it/interviewing/developing-your-elevator-speech</a>.</p>

<p>Visit the site and write down what you learned. ### </p>

<p><strong>Make a list</strong> of why you think it is important to build networks to teaching staff members or faculty even in high school. ###</p> 

<strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity:</strong> 
<p>Write a one- or two-minute elevator speech or pitch (about 90 words) &mdash; key information you can use to sell yourself in the time it takes to ride an elevator. What can you say about yourself and your interests that could intrigue people you might meet? Describe who you are, your key strengths, what you are interested in doing, and how you can be a resource to others. Make it short, interesting, and <em>humble</em> — not an easy task. ### </p>

<p>Now practice with a partner. Find two partners to try out your elevator pitches together &mdash; and then go beyond the pitch to see if you can find common interests or complementary skills that could create value in forming a networking relationship. You will continue to refine your elevator pitch as your skills and interests change and you modify it to fit specific people and situations. ### </p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> Networking simply means the ability to create, build, and maintain relationships with others. You should strive to build a strong network of people that can help you in different situations whether in personal problem solving and development, college admission and advancement, job search and careers, and/or financial advice. Knowing whom to ask for help will build your confidence to connect with them; such connections will create opportunities and make you feel less isolated. It is how the world works. It will get you through high school, into and through college, and into a job.</p>

<p>People in your network come from all areas of your life &mdash; family members, teachers, faith leaders, and even your barber. In this video, Krishaun is really using his barber as a sounding board &mdash; hearing himself explain the decisions he's made and thinking about what's next. It's his fourth year at Fisk and he's getting ready to graduate. What's significant is that he is heading back home to Chicago and returning to Urban Prep, his high school. He has promised them that he'll give them a year after graduation to be a mentor to students, to offer guidance similar to what he gained from in high school. Urban Prep is offering him a place to stay and a monthly stipend. <a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>: <em>"Building your networks, including finding people in your life who will listen to you, guide and support you, can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What does Krishaun say was his purpose in going to college? Why do you think it's important to him to return to Urban Prep? Do you think it will "open doors for him"? What do you think will happen next for him? Why was the barber a good sounding board for Krishaun at this time of his life?</blockquote>

<p>Think back to Chapter Two on career paths and academic majors and remember our question about how successful people were able to stay in the career game. One of the key answers is: having a strong network of people who can provide needed connections and assistance. But the same is true for getting into college. It helps to talk to people who are in college and maybe at schools that interest you. You can learn what they did in high school to be where they are today.</p>

<p>According to the Alumni Career Services website of UCLA Anderson School of Management, "Networking is the single most powerful means of successful career management and is, by far, the most successful job strategy. The 'career <strong>resilient</strong>' executive understands the need to have a developed network before needing to use it for career purposes." Beginning now and expanding that effort throughout college and beyond will help to position you for success.</p>

<p>Notice the reference to "before needing to use it." The same is true in high school and college. Build relationships with your teachers or coaches or advisers so they know you. Then, when you need a reference from them &mdash; to get into college or graduate school, or to secure a job or internship &mdash; they will know exactly what to write about you so you can achieve the school or position you want. Krishaun hears this same message from his adviser, Dr. Peters in the next video.</p>

<p>Both at Urban Prep and in college Krishaun and Robert built relationships with teachers and administrators who could be their guides and mentors for years to come. Watch the video of Krishaun talking to his academic adviser, Dr. Sheila Peters who is an associate professor of psychology at Fisk. She seems to know Krishaun well. Dr. Peters asks Krishaun how he is doing in his classes. She finds out that he has not been meeting with his professors and advises him to do that. She tells him, "I want to make sure you continue to build those relationships...." <a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Identifying and developing mentors, including faculty, can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> In what ways is his academic adviser an effective mentor to Krishaun? How does Krishaun respond to her advice? When is the best time for students to connect with their teachers? How is the opportunity for seeking help different depending upon whether you are doing well or in trouble academically?</blockquote>

<p>Building relationships with a range of current and potential supporters and using those networks effectively leads to collaborating with others &mdash; another life strategy that is successful in school and in job and career situations. Even on the job, internal networks can keep you in the loop and help advance your career. And ultimately your personal networks can keep you mentally and physically healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Story Sharing:</strong> Interview a mentor, teacher, or other figure you admire and ask how they connect to people and build helpful networks. ### Here are some things to ask:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What networking strategies were useful?</li>
	<li>Did they have to overcome shyness to feel comfortable in approaching strangers who could be helpful?</li>
	<li>Did they have a conversation starter that worked (some ask about the weather, for example, or comment on the situation they are in)?</li>
	<li>In what ways have their networks been most helpful?</li>
	<li>Did they need a special connection to secure a job that hadn't been advertised?</li>
</ul>
<p>With practice even those of you who prefer ideas and privacy over interaction with others can be successful at networking. You'll need to work harder to structure opportunities such as making specific appointments to meet with people or attending scheduled events. Discussing what's happening at the event you are attending will eventually bring the conversation around to who you are and what you are interested in (the elevator speech).</p>

<p>You can use written communications as another strategy to build and maintain networks. These may range from writing a thank you note to sending articles about a person or job area of mutual interest. Give people your business card (perhaps with a note of interest) and collect the business cards of people you meet such as a speaker you've heard. Follow up with a "thank you" email. People <em>love</em>to be remembered and recognized.</p>

<p>Another way to build your network along with very practical workplace skills and knowledge is by using online learning communities. Where study groups used to be limited to your school campus (and these are still valuable), you can go beyond those gates to learn with a larger online community or team to achieve shared learning objectives. This is how work in a global marketplace is increasingly being done, so it is important to learn how to work this way. Data and reports can be shared. The group can work using tools like Adobe Connect, which allows group members to see each other while working together. But more basic tools are also used like Google groups or message boards.</p>

<p>Discovering the range of assistance available can guide you in building a support team of diverse resource people from everywhere.</p>

<strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity:</strong>

<p><strong>Make a list</strong> of people in your life who could be effective mentors to you. (See category examples below.) ### Next to each name, <em>identify how they could be helpful to you:</em> college admission, job search, career field information, personal problem solving, financial advice, leadership development, or study strategies. Try for a really long list! ### </p>

<p>What strategies can you use to approach them? Whom have you chosen and what have you done already to build ties to potential mentors?</p>

<p><strong><em>Category examples</em></strong> <em>could include: family member, friends, employer, teacher, teaching assistant, professor, dean, school counselor, academic adviser, faith leader, member of the <strong>congregation</strong>, coach, school band or orchestra leader, mental health counselor, financial aid officer, social or academic club member, residence adviser, fraternity brother, tutor, librarian, office of diversity adviser, doctor, barber, school or college alumni, and others.</em></p>

<h3>Topic 2: Fear of asking for help</h3>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> Fears can keep you from building needed relationships, so here we address how to face and manage your fears realistically. A key reason for students failing to meet expectations is the fear around seeking help or asking questions. The expectations themselves become a barrier. If a person believes himself or herself to be "just fine," then why would they need to get help or guidance from someone else? Those of you who have always done well in high school are often surprised to find things in college to be more challenging than you had anticipated. When you receive that first grade below an A or B, you may be too embarrassed to talk to someone and reluctant to ask for help. That might seem, in your mind, to mean that you are not ready for college, when in fact you are ready. Men especially need to make finding support a value.</p>

<p>During a meeting with his adviser, Dr. Sheila Peters, Krishaun explained that he "tried to do things myself instead of bringing other people into it." He said he would feel as though he accomplished something. Instead, Krishaun has one class that he is passing, two classes that he is failing, and one that he dropped. Dr. Peters advised Krishaun to talk to his professors to see what he could do to pull up his grades. This meeting took place in Krishaun's junior year. How much better if he had asked for help earlier &mdash; and made a practice of connecting with his professors and asking for help beginning in his freshman year. <em>Do not try to tough it out alone! </em></p>

<p>Watch (or read) the Urban Prep Creed again and pay attention to its language about how supporting one another is a strength. (<a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to Creed.</a>) How can you use the creed to help yourself? Earlier we suggested that you create one that fits who you are and what your goals are. What would it say to motivate you every day to stay on course through high school and into college?###  Note, in particular, its emphasis on the community and mutual support. This creed helped Robert and Krishaun finish high school and college &mdash; and can provide guidance for their lives beyond school.</p>

<p>Students like Robert and Krishaun know that they need a college degree and are determined to finish high school and then college. However, if you are like them, the odds are that you don't know what the rules in college are, whom to trust or turn to, or what the processes are to correct your mistakes. A good rule is to meet regularly with your instructors – so they know you – before you get in trouble academically. Knowing how to ask questions and ask for help are skills that good students and good leaders use effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Write down</strong> situations in which you have been successful in finding the help you needed. Think about who can help you right now. ###</p> 

<p><strong>Story Sharing:</strong> Can you think of stories (film, theater, or television) that showed fear getting in the way of what a character wanted to do? One good example is the hit Broadway play <em>In the Heights</em>, which is centered on the story of Nina, a child of the barrio and the first in her family to go to college (Stanford). Her financial problems lead to difficulties with her studying, and her academic standing falls. <em>She tells no one</em> and fails to ask for help until the deans tell her it is too late. She goes home in shame and only with great difficulty tells her family that she has left school. The family and community had seen her as heroic in escaping the poverty of their lives. Her fear of disappointing them is made more painful when she drops out of school. Think about her silence, too. Try and recall a favorite TV show or movie in which a character's silence created a problem or made one worse. What problem was created and what were the consequences? From whom could the character have sought help? ###</p>

<h3>Topic 3: High school and college personnel expect questions and requests for help from students</h3>

<strong>Hands-on Problem-Solving Activity:</strong> 
<p>Identify and listareas in which you are fearful of asking questions related to progress in high school or college. Create scenarios to imagine what the worst case outcome might be (nothing life or death). For example, if you are afraid to speak up in class, what is the worst thing that can happen if you do speak up? Are your fears realistic? How much do your fears have to do with self-image (fear of looking dumb or silly or affirming a negative stereotype based on gender, race, or other differences)? ### </p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> A situation that doesn't seem to make sense is that while students go to college to learn, they feel as though they should act like they know everything already. Either they don't want to look dumb by asking questions, or think they look cool by staying silent, or they actually think they do know everything &mdash; until they find out that they don't.</p>

<p>For students of color, appearance and reality are important to consider. As people of color or those coming from difficult circumstances, we have been so battered that our egos are more fragile. We are more fearful of failure or appearing stupid, or any of the behaviors that trigger what Dr. Claude Steele has identified as "stereotype threat." Dr. Steele identified this very powerful force in which students, based on gender or ethnicity, underperform when they think that their actions may affirm a negative stereotype. It shows up on standardized tests like the SAT, in women taking math tests, or with students just not asking questions in class.</p>

<p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> In what situations have you been afraid of not looking smart or not looking as though you belonged? What was the situation and how did you overcome your fear?</p>

<p>You want to be cool and fit in. This extends to using resources like tutoring centers or faculty office hours or advisers. Being seen with a tutor could suggest a failure as opposed to a desire to improve yourself. The cool factor creates a fear of doing anything that might look geeky, or "white," or stupid. Some cultures are self-sufficient and do not trust help from outsiders or fear the airing of dirty laundry if the sharing involves family or financial matters. But these barriers, ideas, or biases have been preventing students like you from finishing high school and college. Getting help is a life skill &mdash; and one practiced by successful people.</p>

<p>Colleges expect you to come in knowing not very much and to leave knowing a great deal. That won't happen unless you realize that faculty and other college personnel are the keys to learning what you don't know. Watch the video of Dr. Sheila Peters to find out how faculty questioning in classes and guidance offered through one-on-one conversations are part of that process. Dr. Peters asks students in her class, "How many of you have had someone tell you that you can't be anything?" What could you say to a child who doesn't think "they can make it?" She explains that one of our challenges in colleges and schools is to help people become more active learners. One of the advantages of Fisk is that it's a small environment. She feels that can benefit kids in that they can have more relaxed conversations with faculty and staff &mdash; in the cafeteria or walking in the campus yard. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>,<em>"Taking full advantage of all opportunities and resources to gain knowledge can make all the difference." </em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> How would you answer Dr. Peters' questions? How would you deal with any negative expectations others may have for you? How can small talk with a professor build a personal relationship so s/he wants to invest in your future? Can you see how you may have to change in order to do well in college? How might this change be useful in the long term?</blockquote> 

<p>In that clip, you can also see how well Dr. Peters understands her students and is willing to help them. The work of faculty begins with inquiry. That is the language and process they understand. So those who are interested and curious benefit from their positive attention. See my blog: "The Virtue of the Noisy College Student." <a href="http://huff.to/Vn7rDa">http://huff.to/Vn7rDa</a></p>

<p>One way to get to know college faculty is to use their office hours, which are listed on the syllabus or announced in class. Faculty often sit alone during those hours because students don't come. But the reality is that faculty are more likely to be impressed by students who ask questions. They think you are curious and interested. Prepare for your meeting. You can ask about something discussed in class or if you have questions about an assignment. Perhaps you want to talk about your ideas for a paper that is due or ask for suggestions on more background reading.</p>

<p><strong>Make a list</strong> of what you might want to ask or discuss with individual teachers or faculty. ### Then, go and do it!</p>

<p>Teachers, advisers (who are called advisers because their job is to <em>advise students</em>), deans, teaching assistants, and tutoring centers are all available to answer questions. They want you to obtain the information you need to succeed in college and beyond. YOU pay their salaries with tuition dollars and so it would be dumb not to use what you are paying for. It would be like buying a hamburger and leaving the meat behind.</p>

<p>People &mdash; your connections &mdash; are vital to reaching college and then employment goals. You will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Need recommendations from faculty and deans,</li>
	<li>Seek information about opportunities from the career office and alumni, and</li>
	<li>Create networks through your internships and work situations.</li>
</ul>



<p>A biography by civil rights and corporate leader Vernon Jordon, <em>Make it Plain</em>, shows how this worked repeatedly in his life, which has been extraordinarily successful. Throughout the book, he talks about how his path has crossed with colleagues, friends, and employers who ultimately, often at critical points, made all the difference in his professional advancement.</p>

<p>If careers are built on networks and relationships, then creating a reputation as someone who is great to be around, reliable, polite, has <strong>integrity</strong>, and is hard-working are <strong>attributes</strong> you want to cultivate while young. Note that the reverse is also true: a reputation can be harmed through negative behavior whether in person or online. Employers and colleges are now looking at your social media to see what kind of person you are. Make sure your Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, or Instagrams offer a positive look at your ideas and behavior. Review your email address, Facebook pages, Tweets, and other social media messages from the point of view of a potential employer or college admissions committee. Clean up anything you think they might find questionable. ### The Internet is forever. Don't put up anything that may haunt you in the future.</p>

<p>Some movies show the class clown or nerd triumphing over the captain of the football team when a reunion rolls around. But in real life those who are leaders on campus are often leaders later in life. Drew Faust, president of Harvard was both president of her class and the student body when she was an undergraduate at Bryn Mawr. Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis (D-GA) was a college student when he was a leader of the 1963 March on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. President Obama was also a student leader. Their reputations from their undergraduate days have followed them. It is no accident that classmates of heralded figures are interviewed by the media when someone like Eric Holder becomes U.S. Attorney General.</p>

<p>Various people will see you differently depending on their roles in your life, and so you need to know which people to call upon for references. Some understand you well and can easily identify special qualities and talents you may have. Robert and Krishaun both encounter people on campus who see their strengths and promise and who see past the stereotypes.</p>

<p>From what you have seen in the film and videos so far, who are the significant people in Robert's and Krishaun's networks? Note how all of their relationships to various people as well as their jobs and extracurricular activities, beginning in high school, are making all the difference in building their networks. <strong>Compare</strong> their networks to the list of people in <em>your</em> support network. Add or make changes to your list, focusing on which people can be most helpful to you. ###</p>

<p>The truth is that employers prefer employees who ask for help, learn from their mistakes, and have <strong>humility</strong> enough to recognize what they don't know. Employees who want to succeed seek advice from those who are smarter than they are. The kind of inquiries you practice in college is part of the dress rehearsal for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Write down a story in which youhave come to the rescue or been the anchor for a friend. How have you been crucial to the support network for another person? How did that make you feel? ### Again this may show up as useful in a personal statement or even an interview.</p>


<h3>Topic 4: Getting help from the right people in your school</h3>

<strong>Hands-On and Problem-Solving Activities:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>List the <em>free</em> resources available for support in your high school or college. (Examples include teachers, career services, tutoring centers, writing centers, academic advisers, financial aid, registrar, health services, counseling, library, alumni affairs, student affairs, dean of students, coaches, chaplains &mdash; and more.) ### </li>
	<br>
	<li>Findthese offices and know where they are. Take literature from each so you will remember it when you need it. Write down the name of a person in that office for future reference, or better yet, introduce yourself. ### </li>
	<br>
	<li>Practice with a good friend, or at least in front of the mirror, how you will begin a "request for help" conversation to make it less scary. ###</li>
</ul>

<p>Colleges often offer first year "how to" classes/programs that help students to find and use tools and resources. Here's what Robert learned from his class and how helpful it was. "First year studies is a class that every first year takes at Lake Forest.... Basically I've been [seeking help from] my first year studies teacher, who happens to be my academic adviser, Professor De Negro.... In first year studies they teach you how to write, to read, and also to think out of the box and get to a comfort zone instead of the standard five-paragraph essay. They push you. You've got to write eight or nine pages and you've got to know how to use and cite your resources."</p>

<p>Dr. Peters at Fisk also talks about teaching a senior seminar for students in their senior year. In it she tells students not to wait until they leave school to build a relationship with somebody. They will need help from school personnel to reach their next steps: graduate school, a job, or another opportunity.</p>

<p>Think about why it might be a bad idea to "blow-off" such a class or seminar?</p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> Colleges are like any other big organizations: they have their own hierarchy (and perhaps bureaucracy). It is important to know who people are so as to engage with them appropriately.</p>

<h4>Sidebar: College Administrative Hierarchy</h4>

<p>A <strong>sample college hierarchy</strong> is presented here. You should always work from the bottom and go up the line when you have a problem. If you start from the top it will be bounced back down the line any way and you may end up with a reputation as a problem person. Setting the right tone and creating a good impression can make all the difference in your outcomes. Again, use your mirror to practice the best way to ask for help. Be courteous.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Colleges are governed at the very top by a <strong>President</strong> who reports to a <strong>Board of Trustees</strong> (prominent figures who may include alumni, other educators, business leaders, individuals with ties to the government, and those with financial resources). The board has an obligation to see that the institution is fiscally viable and well managed.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Below and reporting to the president will be an <strong>Office of the Provost</strong>, who is typically the chief academic officer, overseeing the faculty and curricular issues. (This may vary from campus to campus.)</li>
	<br>
	<li>Other officers may include a <strong>Dean of Faculty</strong>, a <strong>Dean </strong>or<strong> Vice President for Student Affairs (or Student Engagement)</strong>, and a <strong>Chief Financial</strong>or <strong>Chief Administrative Officer</strong>. The latter keeps the money flowing and the lights on. The vice president for student affairs has a large portfolio, which can include enrollment services (admissions, financial aid, bursar, and registrar); athletics; physical and mental health services; residential life; religious affairs; student activities and clubs; and more.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Deans are usually heads of each academic unit or college such as the <strong>Dean for Arts and Sciences</strong>, <strong>Dean for Engineering</strong> or <strong>Dean of the Graduate School of Medicine</strong>, <strong>Graduate School of Law</strong>, or <strong>Graduate School of Business</strong>, and so forth. These deans may report to the provost or the president, but are responsible for the academic guidance of their individual schools.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Advisement</strong> (giving advice to students) may be the job of either an academic dean or the dean/vice president of student affairs. Roles like these can touch every aspect of a student's life. Watch the interview with Jason Meriwether, vice president of student engagement at Fisk. Listen for the multiple and complete ways he and his team work with students. His job (and that of his staff) includes helping students and parents make decisions about which school to attend, financial advice, student orientation, housing on campus, train student leadership staff, academic support and tutoring, and judicial affairs. <a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Knowing how to navigate college and faculty resources can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What strategy does Dr. Meriwether use to convince young black men that the campus is available to support them? What else did he say that would make you comfortable in seeking his help if you were a student at Fisk? List the titles you have heard or know about in colleges. Talk to a college student or alumnus to find out what these people do or look on the website of a local college. ### Remember that they are paid to be there for you &mdash; and paid out of your tuition dollars!</blockquote>

<strong>Homework:</strong>
<p>Write an essay (one to two pages) about jobs, volunteer activities, or leadership roles you have held beginning in 10<sup>th</sup> grade and the range of people and experiences you've come across. How were they helpful and what did you learn? What would people from those situations say about you in a reference? ###</p> 
<p>Write a letter of reference for yourself. Talk about your strengths as others may have viewed them based on what they know about you. ###</p>
<p>Writeabout a situation in which you wished you had acted differently, or what you learned from a mistake. We will discuss strategies for dealing with tough situations later in this guide. You should know that this is a common interview question for a job, internship, or enrollment in a program. ### </p>

<p><strong>Personal Lifelong Learning</strong>: Join LinkedIn, a business or professional social networking service, and create a profile page. ### Keep track of people in your networks. LinkedIn offers ways to recognize the skills of others and that is an easy way to keep on someone's radar. What other ways can you keep your contacts active? Get to know people in your particular field of interest. The college alumni office can help here. Visit this blog: "What You Get for Your College Degree: The Value of Being an Alumnus." <a href="http://huff.to/1pTUw7t">http://huff.to/1pTUw7t</a> Check in with people in your networks periodically to let them know how you are doing and/or ask how they are doing. Share interesting articles or videos. Buy business cards; you'll find inexpensive ones at many online sites. They are well worth the money.</p>

<p><strong>What should you take away from this chapter?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Networking and building networks is a lifetime asset. One of the most important skills you'll need is the ability to develop diverse types of relationships with people ranging from professors or teachers, advisers, and mentors to friends and alumni who can be helpful not only through college but for a lifetime.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You will need to know whom to ask for recommendations and character references for jobs, graduate schools, the bar association, law enforcement, and other fields.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You need to understand the importance of making nice, having a ready smile, and being that reliable and steady person who delivers quality work whom everyone remembers positively.</li>
	<li>Asking questions or for help is a strength and not a weakness. It's also a personal development opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter Four: Slips, Stumbles, and Getting Up Again</h2>

<p>We have all had those times when we wish we could roll back history. The question, however, becomes: how did you correct your slip or stumble and get up again? It is important to learn how to manage the crisis in the moment, and then to reflect on what was learned. You also need to learn how not to create the same scenario in the future. What is important to know is that mistakes are survivable!</p>

<p>Both Robert and Krishaun found themselves facing consequences of decisions that may not have been well thought out or the best choices. Some have had financial or academic implications like Robert's sticking with courses he was struggling with for far too long. Krishaun struggles all the way through school and may have made it to graduation with a less than stellar record. While he has begun his first post-college job at Urban Prep, a low GPA may come to haunt him later as he seeks new employment and needs to compete with graduates with higher GPAs. Had he sought help and support from his advisers and teachers (and others), he could have produced better results.</p>

<p>It has been true throughout history that young people, <em>especially</em> young men, who are struggling for independence and fearful of revealing weaknesses, want to tough it out and take care of things for themselves. The film shows many moments in which Robert and Krishaun play down their concerns, for example, about money, and often talk about toughing it out or figuring things out on their own. That is what we have represented in popular media as the manly way.</p>

<p>Everything about success, however, involves engagement with, support from, and support of other people. It makes all the difference. Think of all those people award winners thank! There is no question that Wes Moore is a manly man, and as evidenced throughout his life story, he has had support from many quarters.</p>

<p>Mistakes certainly have consequences and lessons and support from others can show how to manage them and even how to avoid them if you care to listen.</p>

<h3>Topic One: Making mistakes</h3>

<p>Can you remember maybe an end-of-year scenario when you felt pressure to get everything done &mdash; classes, exams, papers, and even partying? It was easy for some things to become lost in the shuffle. Mistakes were made or mistakes made earlier began to show their consequences. Which scenarios describe what you left undone: classes you did not attend, homework you did not do, forgetting to take a course prerequisite, waiting too late to study for final exams, or rushing to complete a paper or project? Did these situations make you fearful you could undo your high school graduation or college career? Even worse, as the mistake grows larger in your mind, it may seem to threaten your entire life! Some crises are real and dire and some are more manageable. As suggested earlier, when you think through the consequences in realistic terms things can seem easier to handle than our wild and crazy imaginations might suggest to us.</p>

<p>Our purpose here is to highlight times that feel like a crisis or produce stress, then identify the actions you can use to correct mistakes and, maybe most important, figure out how you can avoid the whole situation in the first place?</p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> A frequent college or job interview question is, "What mistakes have you made and what did you do to recover?" The assumption is that making mistakes is normal. It is. The test of character is how people manage them and what they learn from them.</p>

<p>Krishaun's actions to obtain help for a friend at college is a good example of the appropriate way to use university resources in a crisis and also how to keep one's cool. Krishaun's friend Kahari, a fellow Urban Prep graduate and Fisk student was beaten up by other Fisk students. The beating was recorded and posted on Facebook. Another student later told Krishaun about it. Krishaun said he was "enraged and ready to fight," but held himself back from seeking vengeance on his own and, instead, took it to Fisk's security team. Unhappy with their response, he continued up the chain of command, ultimately calling Jason Meriwether, the vice president of student engagement in the middle of the night. Meriwether praised Krishaun's actions, saying it led the school to a quick response. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Making the right decision at a crossroads in your life can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What did Dr. Meriwether mean when he said, said that Krishaun "took such a major leap?" What might have happened had Krishaun taken action on this own? In what situation have you been that made you seek help from someone in administration at your high school or college? How did it work out?</blockquote>

<p>We have all been situations in which we have lost our cool. Over time, I hope you have already discovered that it is not effective and can actually do harm. For young people in particular, losing your cool can end up with your being punished or worse. However, sometimes acting calmly but persistently can earn rewards or at least respect. Look at the civil rights era sit-in demonstrations to see perfect models of self-restraint, which ultimately won huge rewards for all of us. <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_sit_ins">http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_sit_ins</a> ###</p> 

<p>List your own strategies for holding on to your temper. Do you have a strategy to remind yourself to remain calm when needed? ### </p>

<p>How were the people you know able to turn around their lives when confronted with real challenges like losing a job, having an illness, or violence? Do you know about resources &mdash; mental health therapy, 12-step programs, faith, and places of worship in your community &mdash; that can help turn your life around? List all the resources and people you can turn to in a crisis. ### </p>

<p><em>Everyone</em> makes mistakes and baseball is often used as an analogy in thinking about winning and losing. The number of at bats is significantly higher than the number of home runs. Does this mean that each at bat without a home run is a "failure," while the home run is the win? Does it make a difference that you have to have one in order to have the other?</p>

<p>Too many students give up before the game is over. To continue the baseball analogy, assume that teachers, advisers, and tutors represent the coaches who are there to improve outcomes. If you are in a strange town, you don't wander around for hours looking for your hotel because you don't know where it is. You stop and ask someone. Makes sense, right?</p>

<p>School is like that. As the new dude in town it is okay to ask for directions. School can actually be a relatively safe space to make mistakes. You go to school to learn and develop. Remember to make that happen, teachers are there to teach you, and advisers to advise you.</p>

<p>Robert and Krishaun have had challenging moments both before they entered college and after. They had courses in which they were struggling and needed to drop to protect their GPAs. Robert had to change his major. Both he and Krishaun had many meetings with their professors as a result of not doing all they could have done to be successful. What challenges and choices do you have right now? Go back and look at your resource lists of people you think can help you. Do you need to create an alternate plan? A change of plan is not a failure; instead, it can offer you another way to move forward.</p>

<p>Both Robert and Krishaun have talked about the need to keep going in very tough situations &mdash; whether on the streets of Chicago or struggling through college classes. In college, they were able to seek and find help, and they did so with success. You should not be afraid to ask questions or seek help. Watch this video to hear a conversation between Krishaun and his adviser, Dr. Sheila Peters. He is fortunate that she persists in "tracking him down" and pushing him to take action. She tells him that he "can't hide out just because you aren't doing what you need to do." <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>Understanding consequences and focusing on what will make for academic success can make all the difference." </em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What are the consequences of Krishaun failing his classes? Does he feel any responsibility to the people who care about him and are counting on his success? What changes should Krishaun make to his life at Fisk in order to get better grades?</blockquote>

<p><strong>Story Sharing:</strong> We have all had our moments of less than glory and downright panic. Ask someone you respect to share one or more of their moments of panic when they made a mistake and what they did, its impact on them, what they learned, and how they found the help or tools they needed to get through the situation. ###</p> 

<p>Revisit some of the stories of heroes and leaders (Chapter One) and find moments when they made mistakes or faced daunting challenges. ###</p>

<p>Revisit the challenging situation faced by Krishaun and his handling of the beating of his friend Kahari. He came out OK because he did NOT jump in and try to handle the situation alone, and that made all the difference.</p>

<h3>Topic 2: Managing crises</h3>

<p><strong>Information:</strong> No student is ever fully prepared for college life &mdash; and this can be a root cause of all types of crises. Krishaun acknowledges that he is not sure he can even get up in the morning without his mother waking him. Sometimes the fear of college even stands in the way of finishing high school. Our fears can stop our dreams. Listsome of the comforts of home or differences between high school and college life that you think could be tough for you to handle &mdash; for example, not having scheduled assignments every day, making new friends, or having to be a self-starter). ### Now, listsome resources available at college that can offset these challenges, e.g., orientations, roommates, time management workshops, and clubs. ###</p> 

<p>Like all students during their years in college, Krishaun and Robert are challenged by high stress situations. College usually offers three kinds of crises: <strong>personal/emotional, academic</strong>, and <strong>health and well being</strong>. Actually these are the main types of challenges you find in both high school and college. They often overlap as, for example, when a problem with a class or a friendship leads to not eating or sleeping properly and ultimately leads to an illness. Robert and Krishaun have to solve problems involving each of these three issues at some point in their college careers.</p>

<p>Let's begin with the question of fitting in and social life at college as this can affect so many other things including academics and health.</p>

<p><strong>Personal/Emotional:</strong> Events and relationships in your personal life can result in emotional distress. These are sometimes difficult to manage because they can make you feel out of place, left out, or incapable of coping. Keeping silent and avoiding people and situations is not a solution. When we deny the emotional pain we're feeling, it can pop up in new forms. Author Terrie Williams has written a powerful book called <em>Black Pain,</em> which discusses how hard this situation of silence and denial hits black communities; she shares stories from many celebrities including Judy Holliday and Joseph Simmons of Run DMC who have experienced this as well as young men in gangs who found their way out when they dealt with the issues that led them to high risk behaviors.</p>

<p><strong>Race and Class</strong> For all students going away from home to college, finding their way in a new environment can be challenging. Students from low-income communities are often very uncomfortable on campuses in which they see so many students whose families obviously have much more money and resources. This can be tough. It can be about not having things others have or fear of being seen as somehow less than others. Robert was tested by being in the minority of students of color on Lake Forest's predominantly white campus, a feeling made more intense by differences in family wealth. It may be "stop and frisk" or what is now called "shopping while black" or other forms of slight. This can be especially tough for black males. Read this blog: "And We Wonder Why Black Men Struggle." <a href="http://bit.ly/1hBl1Ll">http://bit.ly/1hBl1Ll</a><p>

<p>Dr. Carl Bell, a professor of public health and community psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, compares the situation of poor white people in Chicago with that of poor black people. He would describe Robert and Krishaun's Englewood neighborhood as a "toxic environment." He says that people living in a "poor black ghetto community," are "kind of like fish in a barrel and so the police hunt you." Bad outcomes are not always the result of such an environment &mdash; because these communities also have "protective factors" such as mothers, fathers, grandparents, friends, churches, sports teams, afterschool programs, and teachers. <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Overcoming or leaving toxic environments can make all the difference." </em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What support structures or protective factors did you see in this clip that helped Robert to achieve &mdash; to graduate from high school and enter college? How well prepared do you think he is to begin college at Lake Forest? Think about being in his situation: what are the kinds of things that you would find the most difficult to adjust to or fit in?</blockquote>

<p>The issue of race can itself be a stressor. A college campus is as subject to bias as any other institution. Robert, in particular, finds it challenging to attend the predominantly white, affluent school he has chosen. He feels that he is not as trusted or viewed as trustworthy because of his background and ethnicity, and has to decide how he will adapt or cope. When SIM cards and a device to read the cards was missing from the public safety office in which he was working, Robert felt that he was the first person at whom they pointed a finger. He also felt that race played a big part in it. As a result, he cut back on his working hours. He described himself as someone "who likes to keep a low profile and just keep it moving. I do what I've gotta do and that's it." He didn't want to be in a position to be falsely accused. Later in the clip, Dr. Judy Dozier, associate professor of English and chair of the African American studies program at Lake Forest College, talks about Robert's character, integrity, and sense of himself. As challenging as his background has been, she believes it "has had some really positive affects on his ability to get out and be comfortable and function where he is." <a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>,<em>"Not allowing stereotypes to define or derail you can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> Dr. Dozier remembers one student who said she "felt like a black stain on a white t-shirt." What do you think that means? Have you been in a situation in which you felt like that? Have you been in situations in which you have faced discrimination or negative assumptions based on a stereotype? Do you have ways that you usually respond? How has that worked out for you? Have you discussed with others the best ways to deal with both other's false beliefs and your own feelings?</blockquote>

<p>The reality is that students of color all face some form of discrimination. Indeed all of us have faced some time in life in which we were a minority in some respect. High school itself can be a tough environment with its cliques. It is good to discuss with a friend or mentor what those situations feel like and how you have dealt with both the situations and the feelings. The reality is that handling these situations badly can have unplanned for consequences. ###  Admitting your feelings can help you deal with them. Building a strong support network will help you stay on track.</p>

<p>By attending Lake Forest, Robert is in a situation in which he has to be more self-aware as a black man. He essentially discounts the attitudes of those who may stigmatize him. This is a challenge faced by minorities that can become self-defeating through self-destructive or depressive behaviors. Learning how to cope in positive ways becomes a critical lesson but one that takes its own toll as people of color have learned over generations. It is important to have a supportive community in which you feel at home and less isolated; a support network of people also enables you to talk openly about your feelings.</p>

<p>In this video, Robert admits that "It's been hard being a black man at Lake Forest College." He believes he's doing something most African-American men aren't doing &mdash; attending a predominantly white college. He says he can "feel the vibe" when he walks into the classroom. <a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Knowing how to embrace diversity can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> Does Robert feel that he made the right choice in going to Lake Forest? What actions did you see &mdash; or comments did you hear &mdash; in the video that tell you that Robert is comfortable being there? What have you done to become comfortable with new people or people who are different from you, maybe on a job for example? Is your current supportive community a reason not to leave home &mdash; or do they motivate you to try new experiences?</blockquote>

<p>Supreme Court Justice Sonya Sotomayor talks about this issue in very practical and real terms in her autobiography, <em>My Beloved World.</em> Justice Sotomayor found out early that she did not have the exposure to art and culture that her classmates did. She was unsure of how to dress and knew that she did not have the kind of wardrobe her roommates did. What was important was that she found a community of other students and upperclassmen who came from environments like her own who could help her find her way and become more comfortable with who she was. Read my blog: "Just Do What Justice Sotomayor Did." <a href="http://huff.to/1pVXLMD">http://huff.to/1pVXLMD</a>.</p>

<p>Mentors can help with academic coursework as well as offer guidance through the ways of college, as Krishaun found in his mentor Mar-Qo at Fisk. Mar-Qo tells him, "[As your mentor] there will always be something that I can offer to you. Likewise there always will be something that you can offer to somebody else. I'm not going to get off your back.... I just want you to stay encouraged, man. I really enjoyed this conversation. I'm hoping that you got something from it.... I try my hardest not to, you know, impose my feelings or my views on you. I just try to give you examples...of things that happened to me and to make you think about stuff."</p>

<p>Your social life, as it is for all teens, is a key focus. How you deal with it can make or break your future. Social life on campus is a challenge under any circumstances. Both Robert and Krishaun have different girlfriends over the years. They work at finding friends they can trust and with whom they can be comfortable. You know that some friends &mdash; romantic or not &mdash; will stand up for you and others will not. It is important to have a comfort level with people to whom you are close. Relationships from home may no longer seem to fit as you have new experiences and move ahead in becoming an adult. Finding this comfort level and the shifting of ties can add to the stresses of college life especially when families are no longer close by.</p>

<p>Think about times when you have felt different from everyone else. What helped you? Has fear of being uncomfortable restricted your life, keeping you in a small neighborhood for example?</p>

<p>Look for schools and programs that offer academic and social supports; that can even be a factor in your selection of a college. High schools like Urban Prep (attended by Robert and Krishaun) or the Eagle Academy schools and special programs like the Boys and Girls Clubs, Prep for Prep, or fraternities can provide comfort zones for social life and can yield greater success for both high school and college students. The Posse Program, the Academic Achievement Program at New York University, and the Black Male Initiative at City University of New York, among others, all have evidence supporting the greater success rates of students from comparable backgrounds who take part in their programs. You can also seek to be part of greater solution-based inclusion efforts, taking part in campus organizations or initiatives that are welcoming to all students and build a learning community. Ask what is available at the school you are attending.### This also has the benefit of building your self-esteem and helps you develop the skills and reputation for being a problem solver. To find out more, read my Blog called "Your Peeps Can Get You Through." <a href="http://huff.to/1nlmnuH">http://huff.to/1nlmnuH</a></p>

<p>Students including Robert and Krishaun also have challenges in dealing with new people including the choice of friends or mates. Robert talks about the limitations in his social life because he feels different as a black man at Lake Forest. By contrast Krishaun feels he will have an easier social situation because Fisk, as a Historically Black College or University (HBCU), has greater potential to feel like a family. Think about how friendships develop and how they may change. For example, at one point, Krishaun's social life changes and he becomes more isolated. Do you expect that you will stay close to people from high school? List the important qualities you look for in friends. ###</p> 

<p>Social life is a hugely important part of the college experience. Being social is also a major distraction, but that is true inor out of college. Much of what has been said about healthy friendships applies to dating as well. A good relationship is based on respect and friendship first. What are examples of healthy relationships? Think about what you have seen as good and bad relationships in your own families or in the media and then think about the qualities or behaviors that would be important to you in a friend or partner.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the reality is that hooking up or casual sex is as likely to occur as anything more meaningful. In that case, be responsible.</p>

<p>Both men and women should carry protection, be aware of their surroundings, and know what they are drinking. Robert and his high school girlfriend Chrystal made a decision not to have sex. Krishaun finds that a woman he was involved with is pregnant with his child. Abstinence is not the only strategy to prevent pregnancy. You should be knowledgeable about how to have safe sex and find resources on campus that support that. Health services, for example, may offer free condoms and information. Watch the video showing Robert with his grandmother and, later, with his girlfriend. His grandmother says, "Don't have a girlfriend here and get her pregnant. Her mama will be cursing me out." Robert and Chrystal talk about why they are not having sex. <a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Abstinence or practicing safe sex can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What reasons do Robert and Chrystal give for not having sex? What does Robert say that tells you he is focused on the future &mdash; and not just living in the present? Both Robert and Chrystal use the word "respect" in relation to one another. Why is respect important in relationships?</blockquote>

<p>Revisit the question of how much our avoidance fears have to do with self-image (fear of looking dumb or silly or affirming a negative stereotype as a black male). How does this apply to you in your relationships?</p>

<p><strong>Academic Crises</strong>: An academic crisis may look like this scenario: A student has been going along for several weeks, not really understanding the course lectures nor the assigned readings. Since the knowledge in many fields including languages, math, and biology builds directly on what has gone before, the longer students wait to acknowledge a problem, the deeper in trouble they are. And they know it. But they assume that everyone else is doing just fine, and so keep quiet in class. They don't want to show up at the tutoring center because it feels stigmatizing. They study for hours, reading the material over and over, still failing to understand it. Then the student fails the midterm. Other distractions occur and things become more complicated. Sound familiar?</p>

<h4>Steps to Manage an Academic Crisis</h4>

<p><em>I CAN Finish College</em> (Chapter 9 on crises) lists 18 items that students can do to deal with an academiccrisis, including a formal appeals procedure. Here are some steps you can take when you think you may be close to failing a class.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Talk to your teachers or professors immediately.</strong> They are happy to help. They prefer it if they know there is a problem, rather than puzzling later when the student does not do well. All faculty have office hours, and students should use them, or you can see them after class. You should explain honestly what you do not understand. That conversation may itself turn the situation around.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Form study groups.</strong> Forming or joining a group of students with different ideas, subject knowledge, and diverse ways of thinking and approaching problems can help all of you work together to crack the code of whatever issues are in front of you. Each offers different strengths.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Make use of small group settings</strong> (sometimes called seminar or recitation sections) that may be offered or even required along with large lecture classes. Unlike large lectures, they lend themselves to discussion and asking questions. The goal of these smaller groups is to make sure that everyone understands and can engage in the information presented. They are usually conducted by a graduate assistant who can also become very helpful as a mentor or additional source of information; the smaller setting may help you to know him or her better.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Go to the tutoring center, writing center, or learning center,</strong> often staffed by graduate students or upperclassmen, guided by professionals, who are good at the skill or subject at hand.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Use workshops.</strong> Most campuses also have workshops on how to study and time management. If you are really shy you can find out who's running the workshop and plan to meet with them individually.</li>
	<br>
	<li>You can <strong>take a placement test </strong>to be sure you are in the correct class level. You may have scored high enough on the SAT or ACT, but the class in which you have been placed may be taught at a level above your skills. You can ask to be tested to see if your skills match the school's standards for its courses. If not, you may be allowed to take a more appropriate level class to build your skills and confidence.</li>
	<br>
	<li>In college you may be able to drop the course, take an incomplete, or take the class pass/fail. Keep track of deadlines for making these decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take advantage of these excellent strategies and tools. It goes back to overcoming fear and asking for help.In making good on your mistakes, humility can make all the difference.</p>

<p>Watch this video to see how their different support networks &mdash; family, school, and community &mdash; help Robert and Krishaun to stay on track academically. Both of them have struggled with grades and to stay in college &mdash; but they keep going. Robert talks about the "amount of people who helped me get here" such as his grandmother and people in his neighborhood and community. He says, "I can't let anyone down." Krishaun says that his community at Fisk has added to the number of people who motivate him to do better. They make him "strive to be so much more than what my mind even thought I could do." Both Robert and Krishaun mention Urban Prep as part of their networks. Robert describes himself as "pushing myself past my limits to get the job done." He points to his arm saying he has an "R" tattoo for "resilience" and says he guarantees he will put everything he has into finals. "I will be resilient and come out on top." <a href="VIDEO LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"Learning to be resilient, meeting challenges head-on, and surrounding yourself with supportive community can make all the difference." </em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong> What difference has having support networks &mdash; family, school, and community &mdash; made to Robert and Krishaun? Which one, Robert or Krishaun, seems to have a stronger self-motivation to achieve? What makes you think that's true? Think of yourself &mdash; do you have both a support network of family and community AND self-motivation to "come out on top" and achieve academically?</blockquote>

<p>Whom do you go to now when you are having academic difficulties? Do you tend to seek help early or late in the game? Early is best.</p>

<p><strong>Health and Well Being</strong>: An expression, deriving from the Latin <em>mens sana in corpore sano</em>, praises "a sound mind in a sound body." You cannot do well in college (or in life) without taking care of your physical and mental well being.</p>

<p>Teens are notorious for late hours and not enough sleep. But the evidence is in that you will do better with more sleep. Some high schools are even starting their day later to help students get the sleep they need. In college you will have to self-regulate. Remember Krishaun's concern that he may not be able to get going without his mother's help? Robert has to begin his day without the biscuits his grandmother made him in high school.</p>

<p>Stress can lead to physical ailments. Staying up for 36 hours and living on caffeine (or worse) in order to catch up on work that should have been done earlier can reduce physical resistance to illness and result in a trip to health services or a doctor ... and maybe missing the deadline after all.</p>

<p>How we handle personal stresses can have an impact on other behaviors for good or for ill. Sadness over the breakup of a relationship can pop up as overeating. Stress about a family matter may lead to drinking too much. Concern about appearance can show up as exercising to excess or binge eating. Anger over issues of racial bias can show up in depressive or violent behaviors. A neurobehavioral issue could show up as attention deficit disorder (ADD), for example, or predispose someone to addictive behavior or depression.</p>

<p>Watch the following video to find out what Krishaun and Robert do to lower their stress and pursue special interests. Krishaun says, "If I give up, my whole life will be flat and I'm not going to be able to do what I want to do in my life." <a href="LINK"><strong>LINK</strong> to clip</a>, <em>"In coping with stress, talking with advisers, constructive activity, work and faith can make all the difference."</em></p>

<blockquote><strong>Questions:</strong>Who seems to have more stress in his life, Robert or Krishaun? Why do you think that is? What effect has stress had on Krishaun's school work and what does he do about it? Robert's piano teacher praises him for making an adjustment in his playing. What adjustments or changes can you make in different areas of your life to help you to have less stress?</blockquote>

<p>Think about Krishaun's situation. What advice can you give him that will help him to do better in school? ### Think about the importance of getting the right help and balancing work, study, and play.</p>

<p>Some people rely upon their faith to help them manage distress and fear. In the videos on Robert and Krishaun we find out how their faith helps them to believe that things will be okay. Sometimes young people question the relevance of faith and places of worship, thinking they are a place of comfort for an older generation. Later in life, they may return to some faith practices. But it is beneficial <em>now</em> to ask what you believe. How do you explain the unexplainable? What gives you a sense of hope? It may be that it is useful to combine a spiritual practice with some other activity. For example, some find spirituality in yoga or in 12-step programs when appropriate.</p>

<p>Is there a risk that faith may be used to <em>avoid</em> taking necessary actions? Faith may involve taking actions and then letting the outcomes sort themselves out. Millions of people say the Serenity Prayer to themselves to help them sort through change and acceptance: "...grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."</p>

<p>Both stress and illness can be dealt with using college resources. Among the advantages of college life are free health facilities for students (covered by tuition and fees) as well as free gym facilities and counseling services. Major medical care may be covered by parents or family, insurance from an employer, or by low-cost policies that students are required to purchase when they enter college if they have no other coverage. Colleges are also required to have services to support students with disabilities of various kinds including learning disabilities. Again, you pay for these things through tuition, so use them.</p>

<p><strong>Make a list</strong> of what you do now that helps to reduce your stress. ###  Highlight things that are perhaps more healthy (for mind and body) and might even have multiple benefits versus those that do not. This could include playing a sport versus watching reality TV. Using a Wii is better thansitting on the couch!</p>

<p><strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activity:</strong> Revisit or imagine a situation in which you or one of your friends made a crucial mistake, had a personal crisis, or were facing the consequences of high-risk behaviors like a drug overdose. List the available resources that could help in a crisis &mdash; at home, school, work, or in a faith environment. What would you do to resolve the situation? Where might you begin, and what steps should you take, for example, if you were to use the college hierarchy (see information in Chapter Three on hierarchy)? ### Read my blog on why making a mistake is not the end of your life. <a href="http://huff.to/1iPZal7">http://huff.to/1iPZal7</a></p>

<p><strong>High Risk Behaviors:</strong> Be aware of and become informed about the devastating effects of high-risk behaviors. These include using or abusing drugs (including prescription drugs) and alcohol as well as dangers related to sexual behaviors such as STDs and unplanned pregnancies.</p>

<p>Drugs and alcohol can make stressful situations and potential crises worse. Seeking help is better than self-medicating. One of the biggest problems on campuses these days is the use and abuse of prescription drugs to manage mood and productivity. The risk is high for addiction and permanent damage to both physical and mental health. To find out the facts about each drug, visitthe website <a href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/students.html">www.drugabuse.gov/students.html</a>. ### While headlines report student deaths, they seldom report the cases of long-term damage from drug use, in which abusers permanently harm themselves and, in many cases, harm others.</p>

<p>You may feel nothing can go wrong, that you are not at risk, but the statistics show that belief is not correct. Check out the following website on myths that you may have about drug or alcohol abuse is: ###  <a href="http://www.mental-health-recovery.org/myths-facts/">http://www.mental-health-recovery.org/myths-facts/</a>. Most teens who are arrested test positive for drugs or alcohol, which damages their reputations and ultimate employability. Sale and abuse of drugs can show up on a college record and also lead to expulsion or suspension from school. The "benefits" perceived in the moment are fleeting, and the risks long-term and not worth it. Check out some before and after pictures of Meth users as one indicator: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/meths-devastating-effects-before-and-after/23/">http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/meths-devastating-effects-before-and-after/23/</a> Substance abuse is a sign that some form of help or intervention may be needed...and soon.</p>

<p>Sex and dating and drugs and alcohol are also a frequently connected mix on campus and can be a dangerous one. Because of many more incidents of sexual assault being reported, new and stricter federal guidelines regulate how colleges need to respond. You are likely to get training on it at your school.</p>

<p>Many campuses offer talks about safe behavior, but there are also resources to help with the outcomes of high-risk behavior. In each case, you should find resources on campus to address the specific high-risk behaviors that require resolution. First, you must break through the tendency toward silence and "self-sufficiency" that we talked about earlier. Then, seek the help you need.</p>

<p>Another frequent form of stress during college, and one that can lead to dropping out or failure, is a family crisis. Robert has a father in prison and his grandmother is frail. Krishaun's mother loses her job. Divorce is a frequent stressor. A parent has cancer. You may become seriously ill and need to go home. Coming out as gay can become a stressful event in a family. Students face the death of grandparents or friends or, in Krishaun’s case, he loses his brother due to gang violence.</p>

<p>These are absolutely times to seek help. It may be that you need a leave of absence to go home to be with your family, and your dean or adviser can arrange that. These situations are clearly not of your making nor subject to your control. You won't be penalized for seeking special treatment (extensions on papers, course incompletions) at these times. People understand. Counseling services as well as chaplains on campus can talk you through your confusion and pain; they are highly skilled in offering support in these very tough situations. As a dean it was no accident that I had a box of tissues on my desk and a door I could close.</p>

<p>(A caution, there have been students who have fabricated personal crises when they just have not completed their work. So colleges may ask for evidence of the crisis to be sure it is real.)</p>

<p>What is important is to stay the course. The beloved family members would want the best for you and for you to achieve the goals you are striving to reach. Use campus supports to help you get through family crises, death and losses, and still salvage your own future.</p>

<strong>Homework:</strong> 
<p>Write an essay on fear as a factor in correcting mistakes or managing a crisis. What does it feel like? What do you do when confronting it? What would you advise your best friend to do when s/he is avoiding taking action because of fear (like asking for help)? What would you suggest to a friend going down a self-destructive path? What do you know about substance abuse resources in your area or on your campus? Do you know anyone in a 12-step program who would be willing to share their experiences with you? The more you know the more you can be helpful to others. ###</p> 

<p><strong>Personal Lifelong Learning:</strong> Keep a daily diary noting situations in the day that went right rather than wrong. ### What is there to be grateful for in the day? Identify fears that turned out not to be real. Preventive measures: keep a planner, do daily exercise, have a few good friends, and know the rules and how to find the right resources when you need them (e.g., read the college catalog or cultivate ties to an adviser). Identify some books or videos that inspire you and can be turned to in a time of distress.</p>

<p><strong>What should you take away from this chapter?</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>What may feel overwhelming rarely is.</li>
	<br>
	<li>It is important to use all the tools and resources available on campus, in the community, at church, at home, and even on the job to manage, in a timely way, the many things that can come up to derail a college career whether it is an academic, personal, family, health, or other crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping an eye on lessons learned, finding positive role models, and relying upon your faith can be essential. Asking for help is a good beginning and can make all the difference.</p>
