<h2>Introduction and Purpose <a onclick="$('#intro').toggle();" style="cursor: pointer;">&raquo;</a></h2>

<div id="intro" style="display: none;">
<p>The film <em>All the Difference</em> by Tod Lending is a real and compelling view of two determined African-American young men, Krishaun Branch and Robert Henderson as they journey from high school through college. It could be your story, or the story of someone you know.</p>

<p>From the South Side of Chicago, they are on a mission to earn first their high school diplomas and then their college degrees. In a world in which barely half the black males in high school graduate and far fewer go to college, they are in a minority from the beginning. Young men coming from the often crime-ridden streets of south Chicago have better chances of being shot or imprisoned than they have of becoming college graduates.</p>

<p>In some ways the film is a bit of a cliffhanger. We root for their success from the beginning, but are uncertain how it will end. Thanks to a supportive high school (Urban Prep Academies), family members, teachers and mentors, as well as their own will, these two students are beating the odds. The various mentors they develop along the way make "all the difference" in their capacities to be <strong>resilient</strong> and to triumph academically and in life, when few from their backgrounds are able to do so. What we want is for <strong><em>you</em></strong> to be among those young men who make it.</p>
<p>Our goals in this <em>College Bound Students Handbook</em> are to highlight the obstacles that Robert and Krishaun encountered along their journeys to reach and complete college as well as the strategies they used to overcome them. In particular, it illustrates how the two young men effectively used a range of people and resources to help them achieve their dreams of a college degree. What made <em>all the difference</em> for them can serve as a roadmap for you.</p>

<p>The handbook can be used either while viewing the documentary or afterwards &mdash; throughout your own quest to attend college, graduate, and then find your way to a job. It is a tool to help you succeed, which you can use at your own pace.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To help you understand the issues better, you'll find <strong>links to video clips</strong> throughout the handbook. Highlighting the same kinds of issues you are likely to face, the clips feature conversations between Krishaun or Robert and the people who help them &mdash; so you can see and hear their struggles and their search for solutions. Some video clips are directly from the documentary, while others have been specially created to accompany this handbook. They expand on important themes that cannot be fully presented within the limits of the 90-minute show.</li>

	<li>You will find <strong>questions to answer</strong> and situations for you to think about what you would do compared to how Robert or Krishaun handled them. When in college, more than in high school, you will be expected to answer questions based on things you see or read. Our questions help you to practice that skill. Other <strong>interactive elements</strong> feature links to blogs and other resources.</li>

	<li><strong>Self Scoring</strong> gives you an incentive to complete different types of tasks throughout this handbook. The tasks for which you can gain points are noted by ###. Each activity is worth 10 points. At the end of the handbook you will be given a link to see what your score says about you and what you will need to do to achieve your dreams. The more activities you complete, the better prepared you will be for college. You'll also have a higher score!</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage you to use every part of this handbook to find tools and options to make the <em>right choices for you</em>: college, course of study, and life path. It will make you work &mdash; and think. For fun along the way, you can give yourself points as you complete each task. Most important this guide will give you useful information and a new perspective gained from the experiences of students much like you.</p>

<h2>Background: <em>All the Difference</em> Film and Major Characters <a onclick="$('#background').toggle();" style="cursor: pointer;">&raquo;</a></h2>

<div id="background" style="display: none;">
<p><em>All the Difference</em> reveals critical issues confronting young African-American men by interweaving the stories of two young men who graduate from high school and go on to college. According to the Schott Foundation, the average high school graduation rate for black males in Chicago is 39 percent; half of those graduating go on to college. Urban Prep Academies, the charter high school attended by Robert and Krishaun, remarkably graduated and sent to college 100 percent of its senior class. Both young men graduate from their respective colleges in four years.</p>

<p>In a later chapter, Dr. Carl Bell, a professor of public health and community psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, states that youth growing up in a challenging neighborhood like Englewood may also benefit from "protective factors" such as mothers, fathers, grandparents, friends, churches, sports teams, afterschool programs, and teachers. As you watch <em>All the Difference</em>, and view the video clips that accompany this handbook, look for the different types of protective factors and people that lift up Robert and Krishaun to help them create and achieve their dreams. Throughout this handbook, we encourage you to identify and build a network of people whom you can count on to support <em>your</em> dreams.</p>

<h2>Robert &amp; Krishaun's Story <a onclick="$('#robertandkrishaun').toggle();" style="cursor: pointer;">&raquo;</a></h2>

<div id="robertandkrishaun" style="display: none;">

<p><strong><em>Robert Henderson</em></strong> was 17-months old when his father killed his mother. His grandmother Ona, who is now in her eighties, reared Robert and his six other siblings. She is a powerful support in Robert's life with a compelling story of her own. A former Mississippi sharecropper, she escaped to Chicago after suffering years of beatings by her husband. After finding work, she brought her nine children to Chicago, had eight more children, and reared all of them on her own. When Robert arrived at Urban Prep, he was failing math and was at least a grade behind in his other classes. He was vulnerable to joining neighborhood gangs and getting into trouble with the law. He graduated high school with honors and attended Lake Forest College on a partial scholarship, starting with majors in history and pre-med. Robert graduated with a double major in history and American studies and a minor in Asian studies. He then joined City Year, an education organization funded by national service. City Year partners with public schools in high-poverty urban communities to help students graduate from high school ready for college and workforce participation. Teams of diverse AmeriCorps members serve full-time in schools, where they directly support academic achievement and student engagement in and out of the classroom. He is working to pay off his college loans and ultimately hopes to go to medical school.</p>

<p><strong><em>Krishaun Branch</em></strong>
was a gang member as were his mother, father, and uncle. He was reared by his mother and had little contact with his father. Being shot and almost dying years ago was a wake-up call for his mother to leave her gang. She changed her life for her own sake and that of her sons. When Krishaun began his studies at Urban Prep, he was at least a grade behind in math and reading and was still dealing drugs to make money. <strong>Impetuous</strong> and quick to anger, Krishaun was expelled from Urban Prep during his sophomore year for getting into a fight. He begged to come back after briefly attending a regular public school. Urban Prep saw his potential and readmitted him with strict conditions. Following his graduation, he attended Fisk University with partial scholarships and grants. While he had planned to work in law enforcement, Krishaun instead returned to Urban Prep after his college graduation to work as an advisor to students. He is now becoming a father, which will bring new responsibilities and challenges.</p>

<p>During high school these young men were filmed in their classes, at home, and with friends in casual settings. Most of the filming was at school because that was where they spent the majority of their time. The filmmaker spent the next four years following Robert and Krishaun as they advanced toward their college graduations. He continued to follow them for several additional months in order to see what new hurdles and issues they encountered and what strategies, resources, and networking opportunities (how they were able to connect to people who could help them) they used to secure employment and settle into new lives.</p>

<p><strong>Meet Robert and Krishaun</strong></p>
<!--VIDEO GOES HERE-->COVE VIDEO EMBED

<p>The introductory video opens on a chaotic and deadly scene in the South Side of Chicago, the community in which Robert and Krishaun grew up and where their families still live. Segments of the video highlight factors that ultimately made a difference to the lives and success the two men achieved: school (a safe, academically oriented all-male charter high school); mentors, grandmothers and families; college (chosen with a mindfulness of their anticipated careers); academic advisors; and the two young men themselves. Robert and Krishaun talk about the challenges they confront and their determination "to be successful" and not to stop "until I reach my destiny." They will be among the 52 percent of black males who complete high school nationally according to data from the Schott Foundation. They will also be part of the one third &mdash; or 5.5 percent &mdash; of black males who attend college and actually graduate, according to the Maynard Center for Structural Inequality. As the film begins, Krishaun and Robert have the chance to rewrite the future, not just for themselves, but for their families. Will the supports that make all the difference be enough? Just as for them, your choices can make all the difference in where you land in these statistics.</p>

<p>The video is introduced by Wes Moore, a youth advocate, Army combat veteran, and author. His <em>New York Times</em> best-selling book, <em>The Other Wes Moore, </em>is the inspiration for the <em>All the Difference</em> documentary. Wes is a pretty awesome guy in his own right.

<h2>Format and Content of this Handbook <a onclick="$('#format').toggle();" style="cursor: pointer;">&raquo;</a></h2>

<div id="format" style="display: none;">

<p>Each chapter in the handbook covers a different key topic that you can use to make decisions about yourself and your own journey to and through college. Compare your experiences to those you see happening to Robert and Krishaun in the video clips and film.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Chapter One: Expectations About College</strong> &mdash; This chapter explores the sources of expectations you have for yourself, and to what extent these create pressure or provide motivation. It asks why college is important and why self-awareness can make all the difference in finding the right place to be as well as HOW to be. What you do in high school can also make all the difference in your college quest and experience. Researching schools, making the right choices, practicing writing essays, and preparing for the SAT/ACT are part of your journey in high school. Financial considerations also influence whether and where to attend college and the choices you make afterwards.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Chapter Two: Career Paths and Academic Majors</strong> &mdash; This chapter explores the relationship between college majors and careers and the importance of finding the right fit so that ultimately your academic and professional goals are met. It explains how to use college to prepare you for the rest of your life.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Chapter Three: Networks, Relationships, and Resources</strong> &mdash; College is a place in which you will build key networks (people who can help you) for support and tap resources that will make all the difference in achieving your goals. This handbook suggests how to develop these networks. Some of this should begin in high school. Young men, in particular, seem to embrace a culture of going it alone. That attitude and fear can get in the way of your using resources, so this chapter addresses how to face and manage those fears realistically. It explains why and how creating supportive relationships will feed the positive goals and actions that will lead to your success.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Chapter Four: Slips, Stumbles, and Getting up Again</strong> &mdash; We all make mistakes, and college is a relatively safe place to make them. What are the kinds of mistakes you can expect to make and what are the strategies for managing them and succeeding? Learning how to ask for help is key and can truly make all the difference. </li>
	
	<li><strong>Chapter Five: Managing Time and Studying Smart</strong> &mdash; Learning how to make choices and manage time as well as learning how to study effectively are skills that can make or break your college success. College provides more freedom and independence in contrast to how controlled your time was by your high school and family. Be prepared for how different college is from high school &mdash; you will need to manage your own time and study effectively so you can succeed.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Chapter Six: Getting to the End Game</strong> &mdash; This chapter focuses on the post-college job search, graduate school, or other opportunities. Consistently apply the strategies suggested throughout college to make all the difference in achieving your dreams. Some practices are the same you used to get into college. Now you can use them to secure a job or entry into graduate school &mdash; and for many years after college.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>format</strong> of each chapter generally includes the following sections. Some chapters have more than one Information/discussion topic.</p>

<ul>
	<li>An <strong>Information</strong> section helps you to understand more about key topics. For example, one topic may describe why you might resist getting help, while another could explain the kinds of support systems available in colleges and why you should use them. Questions encourage you to think about the issues and situations you are seeing (in the film and video clips) or reading in this handbook. Many of the questions are the kind that you would be expected to answer in a college class, so this is good practice even if you are now in high school.</li>

	<li><strong>Story Sharing</strong> is a chance for you to think about your own life experiences and how they compare to what you are seeing on the screen. You may want to talk to a friend, mentor, or family member to hear their life stories, too. Stories about others and your own self-reflection help you to see more possibilities. </li>

	<li><strong>Hands-On Problem-Solving Activities</strong> help you to identify personal issues and think about solutions, using support structures or tools. What kind of support would help you to achieve a better result?</li>

	<li><strong>Homework</strong> means journaling, research, and written reports so that you can practice the skills you will need for college and beyond.</li>

	<li><strong>Sidebars</strong> in most chapters provide key information that will help you to understand an issue in more depth.</li>

	<li><strong>Personal Lifelong Learning</strong> emphasizes the importance of continuous growth and self-exploration, creating networks, and having a personal "board of directors" to help you gain information and expand your knowledge base. The suggested activities here may include journals, blogs, and social media. For example, you can become part of LinkedIn groups for your high schools and colleges. You can post information about yourself that will help you to connect to others with similar interests and goals.</li>

	<li><strong>What should you take away from this chapter?</strong> Final comments summarize what you should learn and practice from each chapter. </li>

	<li><strong>Resources</strong> at the end of each chapter suggest books, blogs, websites, and organizations that may be useful and relevant. These may be in the form of links to online tools,</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vocabulary building</strong> is supported by <strong>bold green</strong> highlighted words. Students do better on tests such as the SAT/ACT and essay writing when they have a rich vocabulary. Indeed people who are <strong>articulate</strong>, well read, and have a commanding vocabulary advance further in life. We encourage you to look up these highlighted words and begin to use them yourself. You can expand your vocabulary by reading. Even playing word games like Scrabble and "Whirly Words" can help you to improve your word skills while having some fun.</p>
